The left side of the rendering shows a 4-view RGB rendering, and the right side shows a 4-view normal map, showing the surface texture and lighting interaction of the 3D model. The object may be generated by an AI model or may be a scan of a real object.  Please determine whether the object was generated by an AI model. (Answer yes if you think it is generated by an AI model, and answer no otherwise.)\nA: Based on the provided image, I have observed the following inauthenticities in the RGB and normal renderings. For RGB renderings, I have observed that: 气球的纹理不够清晰，同颜色气球之间会出现色彩差异的现象，不同气球间的阴影表达不自然。气球的纹理边缘不够清晰. For normal renderings, I have observed that: 气球的几何表面精度低，不同气球出现了粘连的情况，黄色的气球出现了一定的扭曲，导致与现实气球不符合，法线表面出现不自然的过渡以及噪点等现象。So, Yes. This object is most likely generated by an AI model.\nQ: <image>\nThis is a rendering of a 3D object.

(Answer yes if you think it is generated by an AI model, and answer no otherwise.)\nA: Based on the image, I have carefully checked all regions where inauthenticities may appear. However, I have not observed anything irregular. So, No. This rendering is most likely a scan of a real object.\n<image>\nThis is a rendering of a 3D object.
