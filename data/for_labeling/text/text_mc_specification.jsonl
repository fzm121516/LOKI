The notion that time constitutes an intrinsic quality of the universe, an ever-present continuum existing independently of human experience, is a deeply ingrained assumption. Yet, this assumption warrants rigorous examination. Upon closer scrutiny, time reveals its nature not as an inherent characteristic of things in themselves but rather as a spectral fabric interwoven with the subjective threads of human perception. This perspective aligns with the doctrine that time's objective validity is confined to the sphere of human experience and sensory intuition. Such a view posits that our sensory apparatus and cognitive frameworks act as lenses through which the concept of time is projected, thus conferring upon it a semblance of reality. Absent the filter of human perception, time would dissipate as an abstraction, devoid of substance and independence. It becomes evident that time, in this philosophical light, is not an autonomous entity existing in seclusion from our experiential realities. Rather, it is a construct, a subjective condition tethered inexorably to the phenomenological dimensions of human existence. Consequently, the objective existence of time is not a testament to an external, self-sustaining chronometric reality but a manifestation of our perceptual and cognitive engagements with the world.

Furthermore, to safeguard public health, a certificate of absence of infectious diseases is necessitated, affirming that the deceased did not succumb to any communicable diseases that could pose risks posthumously.\n\nBefore the remains can be dispatched to France, obtaining an import permit from the competent French authorities is vital.

Now this design, although called Fate when looked upon as the compelling force of a cause, the laws of whose operation are unknown to us, is, when considered as the purpose manifested in the course of nature, called Providence, as the deeplying wisdom of a Higher Cause, directing itself towards the ultimate practical end of the human race and predetermining the course of things with a view to its realisation. This Providence we do not, it is true, perceive in the cunning contrivances of nature; nor can we even conclude from the fact of their existence that it is there; but, as in every relation between the form of things and their final cause, we can, and must, supply the thought of a Higher Wisdom, in order that we may be able to form an idea of the possible existence of these products after the analogy of human works of art. The representation to ourselves of the relation and agreement of these formations of nature to the moral purpose for which they were made and which reason directly prescribes to us, is an Idea, it is true, which is in theory superfluous; but in practice it is dogmatic, and its objective reality is well established. Thus we see, for example, with regard to the ideal of perpetual peace, that it is our duty to make use of the mechanism of nature for the realisation of that end. Moreover, in a case like this where we are interested merely in the theory and not in the religious question, the use of the word “nature” is more appropriate than that of “providence”, in view of the limitations of human reason, which, in considering the relation of effects to their causes, must keep within the limits of possible experience. And the term “nature” is also less presumptuous than the other.

This grand symphony, played out on the stage of existence, is perceived through various lenses. Some see it as Fate, an inexorable and enigmatic cause that compels us to dance to its rhythm. Others interpret it as Providence, a transcendent wisdom that guides our steps with a purposeful end, a grand finale for humanity's journey.\n\nYet, the workings of Providence are not laid bare for us to scrutinize. They are shrouded in the veil of nature, obfuscated by the sheer complexity of the world's mechanisms. To grasp nature's alignment with our moral purposes, we must dare to imagine a higher wisdom, a celestial architect that designs the labyrinth of our lives. This act of imagination is not a frivolous flight of fancy but a necessity, for it allows us to reconcile the seemingly indifferent march of nature with our deeply held moral convictions.\n\nConsider the lofty ideal of perpetual peace, a state of eternal tranquility that exists more in our aspirations than in our reality. This noble goal exemplifies how we ought to harness nature's mechanisms, bending them towards our moral ends. Just as a river, with all its twists and turns, ultimately yields to the pull of the sea, so too must we guide the meandering course of nature towards our envisioned destiny.\n\nHowever, from a theoretical standpoint, the term 'nature' is more apt than 'providence'. The limitations of human reason, vast and humbling, caution us against presumption. To claim knowledge of Providence is to claim insight into the mind of the divine, a hubris that oversteps the bounds of our understanding. Instead, let us speak of nature, a term that encompasses the grandeur and complexity of the world while acknowledging the mystery that lies at its heart.\n\nThus, we stand at the intersection of nature and morality, tasked with the daunting yet exhilarating challenge of steering the former towards the latter. We are not mere passengers on this journey but active participants, endowed with the capacity to imagine, to hope, and to strive.

Nuclear power demands uranium mines, reactors, and storage facilities for waste. Meanwhile, renewable energy sources like wind and solar power rely on expansive fields of turbines or solar panels.

To meet this demand, we would need approximately 1,200 square kilometers for fossil fuel production. For nuclear energy, we'd require nearly 4,000 square kilometers. These are significant areas, roughly equivalent to the size of small countries.\n\nUnderstanding these spatial requirements is vital for planning our energy future. It highlights the need for efficient land use, innovative technologies that reduce the spatial footprint of energy production, and balanced approaches that utilize a mix of energy sources.

It is also evident, that the idea, of existence is nothing different from the idea of any object, and that when after the simple conception of any thing we would conceive it as existent, we in reality make no addition to or alteration on our first idea. Thus when we affirm, that God is existent, we simply form the idea of such a being, as he is represented to us; nor is the existence, which we attribute to him, conceived by a particular idea, which we join to the idea of his other qualities, and can again separate and distinguish from them. But I go farther; and not content with asserting, that the conception of the existence of any object is no addition to the simple conception of it, I likewise maintain, that the belief of the existence joins no new ideas to those which compose the idea of the object. When I think of God, when I think of him as existent, and when I believe him to be existent, my idea of him neither encreases nor diminishes. But as it is certain there is a great difference betwixt the simple conception of the existence of an object, and the belief of it, and as this difference lies not in the parts or composition of the idea, which we conceive; it follows, that it must lie in the manner, in which we conceive it.", "message_type": "send", "user_id": "", "parent_id": null}, {"message_id": "a27a3ddd-4970-4693-af2a-0d71bea5c65c", "content": "In the realm of philosophical inquiry, the dissection of causality and its implications on our understanding of existence stands as a cornerstone for metaphysical thought. At the heart of this discourse lies the contention that when we engage in reasoning concerning causes and effects, we are, in essence, delving into the very nature and attributes of objects themselves. Existence, in this context, is not some supplementary notion appended to the concept of an object; rather, it is inherently intertwined with the idea of the object. To claim that one understands the idea of a thing is, ipso facto, to comprehend its existence, for existence is not an added feature but the very fabric of the idea.\n\nTake the notion of God, for instance—a frequent subject in such philosophical musings. When we contemplate God's existence, we are not extending the idea of God with a novel component; instead, we are engaging in a deepened mode of perceiving the idea we already possess. The concept of God, complete with all attributed qualities, encompasses within it the idea of existence. It is akin to understanding that light is inherent to the sun; one cannot separate the sun's existence from its very definition without altering the core of what the sun represents.\n\nThe distinction, then, between conceiving an object and believing in its existence resides not in the elemental makeup of the idea, but in the modality or attitude with which this idea is grasped. To conceive is to hold an intellectual construct, while to believe is to invest faith, certainty, or acceptance into that construct. Belief, in this sense, imbues the idea with a vitality that mere conception does not—transforming it from a passive contemplation into an active affirmation of reality.\n\nThis perspective challenges us to reconsider the dichotomy often drawn between abstract thought and pragmatic affirmation. It suggests that the process of reasoning about causes and effects is, at its root, an endeavor to reconcile our conceptions with the world as it presents itself to us—bridging the chasm between the realm of ideas and the tangibility of existence. In doing so, we come to realize that existence is not an appendage to be tacked onto concepts, but the fundamental premise upon which they rest, shaping our understanding of the cosmos and our place within it.", "message_type": "receive", "user_id": "", "parent_id": null}], "custom": {"id": "8ebe338e-71b1-11ef-a77a-80615f12b4cc_fake_mc"}}

As someone who has always been fascinated by the inner workings of law enforcement, I've had the privilege of participating in multiple ride-alongs with local police departments. These experiences have given me a unique perspective on the various reasons people call 9-1-1, and the often-profound consequences that follow.\n\nWhat I've observed is that, in many instances, these calls can exacerbate the situation at hand, leading to unnecessary arrests, hefty fines, or even the loss of life. I want to be clear: I am not advocating for the abolition of police departments. However, I firmly believe that we need to rethink our approach to crisis intervention and explore alternative solutions that prioritize de-escalation and support over enforcement.\n\nThis conviction was solidified when I discovered a groundbreaking program in Eugene, Oregon, called CAHOOTS. This initiative pairs mental health professionals with EMTs to respond to mental health-related 9-1-1 calls, effectively diverting these situations away from police and toward more suitable first responders. By doing so, CAHOOTS addresses the mental health crisis head-on, reducing instances of police brutality and providing vulnerable individuals with the care they desperately need, rather than a stern lecture or a pair of handcuffs.\n\nIt's time for us to reimagine the role of law enforcement in our communities. By adopting a more holistic approach that integrates mental health professionals and social services into our crisis response systems, we can reduce the risk of unnecessary escalation and create a safer, more compassionate environment for all. The CAHOOTS model serves as a shining example of what can be achieved when we prioritize empathy and understanding over aggression and enforcement. Let us learn from their success and work together to build a better, more inclusive future for everyone.", "message_type": "send", "user_id": "", "parent_id": null}, {"message_id": "31ff330f-b315-40bc-9104-2812c92b5542", "content": "Call me weird, but I love a good ride-along. Like, love them. I've been on ride-alongs across the world — in Amsterdam, in Canada, in Boston, and even right here, in Denver. And what I've learned is that people call the cops for a number of reasons — anything from a lost cat, to a neighbor they just want to know more about, to maybe a loved one or a stranger having a mental health crisis. But really, at the heart of it, people call 9-1-1 because they just don't know what else to do.What I've learned, though, is that sometimes, when you call 9-1-1, it can make a bad situation even worse. Maybe a loved one is arrested, or they're placed on a 72-hour hold; there are fines and fees, and criminal charges. And sometimes, calling 9-1-1 can be the beginning of the end of someone's life. Now, you might think I'm here to talk about abolishing the police. Not exactly. I'm actually here to talk about a different solution, a solution that takes care of a person, keeps our community safe and helps the police to focus on what they do best — enforcing the laws.For me, it all started with a visit to Eugene, Oregon. You see, I had just passed a ballot measure here in Denver, called Caring for Denver, to provide more mental health and substance use services for people in crisis right here, in Denver, when a friend tipped me off to a program in Eugene. Normally, when you call 9-1-1, you get a firefighter, a police officer or a paramedic. But in Eugene, there's a fourth option: a mental health professional and an EMT, who ride along in a van and respond to mental health calls. The program is called CAHOOTS.Studies show that nearly 50 percent of victims of police brutality have a disability, predominantly a mental health disability.

As the dish traversed geographical boundaries, it underwent a fascinating transformation that fused traditional Cantonese techniques with Thai culinary sensibilities, especially flourishing during the prosperous Ayutthaya period.\n\nOriginating as a classic Cantonese-style crispy pork dish, mu krop was traditionally prepared by marinating slices of pork in a blend infused with the signature Five-spice powder—a harmonious mixture of star anise, cloves, Chinese cinnamon, Sichuan pepper, and fennel seeds. This marinade imparted a depth of flavor characteristic of Cantonese cuisine before the meat was grilled over intense heat to achieve a tantalizing crispiness on the exterior.\n\nThe Thai interpretation of mu krop, however, diverged from its Chinese predecessor in both preparation and seasoning. In Thailand, pork belly became the cut of choice, meticulously baked to achieve a perfect balance between a dry, crispy outer layer and a tender, succulent interior. The rind, or skin, transforms into a glistening, golden brown crust that crackles delightfully with each bite, offering a textural contrast cherished in Thai cuisine.\n\nA notable departure from the original recipe lies in the omission of Five-spice powder. Instead of relying on this spice mix, Thai chefs devised an innovative method that involves an additional frying step for made-to-order servings. This alteration not only bypasses the need for the initial marinade spices but also enhances the dish's inherent flavors, allowing the natural taste of the pork to shine while accentuating its crispy texture.\n\nThe adaptation of mu krop in Thailand reflects the country's culinary ingenuity and adaptability. By refining and tweaking traditional recipes, Thai cuisine has embraced mu krop as one of its own, making it a beloved staple that encapsulates the essence of Thai gastronomy—balancing flavors, textures, and aromas to create a dining experience that is both comforting and captivating. Today, mu krop stands as a testament to cultural exchange and culinary evolution, maintaining its allure for locals and visitors alike due to its appealing texture, rich flavor, and deep historical significance.", "message_type": "send", "user_id": "", "parent_id": null}, {"message_id": "028602d7-e13d-4a96-9d72-54e6dc81a9bf", "content": "Mu krop is a dish that originated in Guangdong in Southern China and Hong Kong during the late Qing Dynasty. Chinese citizens from these provinces migrated to settle in many areas of Southeast Asia, and crispy pork, a local signature dish, has therefore spread overseas from the Chinese communities to the new societies, including Thailand.\nThe Cantonese style crispy pork that was first brought into Thailand and is still served in Chinese restaurants. The original Siu yuk is cooked using the method of marinating Five-spice powder before grilling large pieces of pork belly over high heat for several hours until the pork is cooked throughout. This maintains a thick layer of fat and keeps the rind crispy with a faint scent of spices.\nWhen mu krop was introduced to Thailand during the Ayutthaya period, the cooking method developed slightly differently and the pork belly was baked until it was dry and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. In this era, crispy pork was considered an interesting menu item and became very popular in the Thai food market. In the present day, crispy pork continues to gain high popularity. This is a result of the delicious characteristic of shiny golden brown, crispy and crunchy rinds with layers of soft, tender and juicy fat and chewy meat, and the aroma from the mixed seasonings. The crispiness comes from the large amount of porosity and complete dryness on the pork belly's surface along with the consistently high heat temperature, which helps air penetrate the skin layer better. However, unlike the Cantonese style crispy pork, mu krop lacks the spice powder in the original recipe. This evolved as Thai restaurants cooked the meat again in hot frying oil for made-to-order restaurants, rendering the prior seasonings useless.", "message_type": "receive", "user_id": "", "parent_id": null}], "custom": {"id": "8ebd8a56-71b1-11ef-a77a-80615f12b4cc_fake_mc"}}

It's a burst of color and excitement. When I was little, he'd carry me up on his shoulders and I'd marvel at the pageantry. I loved the wizard-like academic robes that all the professors wore. My father explained how you could tell what degree someone had and the school they'd gone to, based on the color and design of their gown and hood. It was like a diploma, a credential that you could wear. I couldn't wait to have one of my own.My dad taught biochemistry for decades and was one of those beloved professors. Graduation, for him, was a frenzy of thankful hugs and handshakes, eager introductions to parents. Countless careers in science and medicine were launched in his Bio 101 class, and it was clear he made a difference.I suppose I inherited a love of teaching from my dad, and I planned to be a professor, just like him. I headed to grad school to do a PhD, studying microbiology and microchemistry. But along the way, my dad's path and mine started to diverge.During long days in lab, I got impatient. I wanted to teach. I didn’t want to wait to graduate and do a postdoc, spend years navigating a treacherous job market. So I turned to the internet, which was breaking down the barriers to entry and removing the traditional gatekeepers in many established fields. From my kitchen table, I started recording tutorial videos, teaching the basics of chemistry using simple, hand-drawn diagrams. I put the videos on YouTube ... and people actually started watching them. First, a few folks, and then more, and then more. Thank-you emails poured into my inbox. I wasn't a professor yet, I hadn't even finished my PhD, but I was helping students all over the world get through their chemistry classes.I got the sense that something big was brewing here. But my dad would hear none of it. When I explained that I was thinking about abandoning the traditional professorship route to explore this new world of online education, he exploded in anger. \"Oh, Tyler, you'd have to be an idiot to think that anyone would care about this stupid YouTube thing.\" I shot back with a dig.

This very college, nestled in the picturesque landscape of New England, holds a special place in my heart—not just as an institution of learning, but as a home to countless cherished memories. My father, a revered biochemistry professor here, walked these halls, imparting not only knowledge but also a passion for inquiry and discovery.\n\nFrom the time I was a child, I was captivated by the intellectual aura of academic ceremonies, the unspoken promise that learning was a lifelong endeavor. I saw the spark in the eyes of my father's students as they celebrated their academic milestones, and it was that spark that ignited my own passion for teaching. I wanted to make the same difference in the lives of students, to kindle that same love for learning. \n\nEmbarking on my PhD journey, I envisioned a future firmly planted in the fertile grounds of traditional academia. Yet, as my studies progressed, I found myself increasingly chafing at its constraints. The rigidity, the formality, the slow pace of publication—it all felt at odds with the swiftly changing world around us. It was then that I turned to the boundless possibilities of the internet, and created a series of educational videos on YouTube.\n\nWhat started as a small venture soon grew beyond my wildest dreams. The videos were met with enthusiasm from students worldwide, young minds eager to learn in a format that matched their pace and style. Each 'like,' comment, and subscriber was not just a number; it was a testament to the impact of accessible, flexible education. I had found a new classroom, one without walls, timetables, or geographical limitations—a true democratization of education.\n\nYet, this new path was not without its hurdles. My father viewed my digital foray with disdain. To him, it seemed less rigorous, lacking the gravitas of traditional lecturing. The tension between us was palpable as he misunderstood my intentions, questioning the legitimacy of this new form of teaching. There were moments of profound sadness, feeling the weight of his disappointment, yet I held resolutely to the belief that what I was doing mattered.\n\nThe world of education is evolving, and with it, the ways in which we reach and teach our students. Today, I ask you, dear graduates, to embrace change, to find your own paths—even if they lead you away from the well-trodden roads. Trust in the power of your impact, not measured by convention, but by the seeds of knowledge you sow in the minds you touch. \n\nThank you, and congratulations to the Graduating Class of [Year].", "message_type": "receive", "user_id": "", "parent_id": null}], "custom": {"id": "8ebd3b64-71b1-11ef-a77a-80615f12b4cc_fake_mc"}}

A classic structure of PM-type OPDs is based on the active layer of P3HT:PC70BM with the weight ratio of 100:1, in which PC70BM forms islands and supply bulk electron traps for inducing strong interfacial band bending and thus hole tunneling from the Al electrode. In this paper, aiming for optimizing the PM effect, we study the photogenerated carrier distribution by tuning thickness of the active layer (P3HT:PC70BM). The combination effect of both the exciton generation and exciton dissociation processes affects the photogenerated carrier distribution, which ultimately determines the PM performances of OPDs. On the one hand, simulation reveals that the thinner the active layer, the stronger exciton generation near the Al electrode. On the other hand, the photoluminescence and surface morphology studies reflect that the active layer with thickness of 230 nm has the smooth surface and produces the highest exciton dissociation rate. The two effects result in the OPD with a 205 nm thick active layer has the champion EQE (105569%) and photoresponsivity (344 A/W), corresponding to an enhancement of 330% with respect to the OPD with a 325 nm thick active layer. Ascribed to the trade off of EQE and dark current, the detectivity performs differently at different wavelength ranges. At short wavelength range, the detectivity reaches the highest when the active layer is 205 nm thick, while the highest detectivity at long wavelength range is produced by the thickest active layer.

The active layer comprises a blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM). Through experimental analysis, the study identifies that an active layer thickness of 205 nm results in the optimal performance of OPDs. At this specific thickness, the OPDs achieve an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 105569% and a photoresponsivity of 344 A/W, indicating a substantial improvement over previously reported values. The enhanced performance is attributed to increased exciton generation proximal to the aluminum (Al) electrode, along with a maximized exciton dissociation rate. Additionally, the analysis reveals that the detectivity of OPDs is wavelength-dependent. The 205 nm thick active layer demonstrates superior detectivity at shorter wavelengths, attributed to the balance between light absorption and carrier transport dynamics. In contrast, thicker active layers excel in detectivity at longer wavelengths due to a higher cumulative absorption capacity. These insights are promising for the development of low-cost OPDs capable of high sensitivity in detecting weak light signals, offering significant advancements in optoelectronic applications.

The longer route, on the other hand, was a smooth, inviting curve, but it bore the ominous mark of Cogia Bux's territory. The mere thought of an encounter with that treacherous scoundrel made our blood run cold.\n\nWe wrestled with the idea of abandoning our precious cargo, of leaving behind the gleaming silks and sparkling jewels that were meant to buy us favor and alliance.

The poet, humbled before the enormity of his task, calls upon the Heavenly Muse, that divine wellspring of inspiration, and beseeches the guiding light of the Holy Spirit, to infuse his words with grace and wisdom.\n\nThis poetic odyssey sets out to unravel the mystifying web of choices that led two souls, so divinely favored, to turn away from their Creator's loving hand. It is an inquiry into the very essence of human frailty, a meditation on why beings enveloped in such profound blessings would defy the one command meant to safeguard their paradise. The narrative yearns to illuminate the labyrinthine paths of temptation, tracing the footsteps that led to the bitter fruit's consumption, and ultimately, the fall from grace.\n\nThe author's quill, thus anointed, embarks on a journey not merely to narrate the past but to clarify the Divine plan's intricacies. It is a quest to demonstrate, through the melancholic beauty of verse, how even in the face of humanity's most tragic mistake, the infinite mercy and justice of God remain steadfast. For within this exploration lies a deeper truth: that from the ashes of Eden's loss, the potential for redemption and the promise of salvation glow, kindled by love's unwavering flame.\n\nThrough this poetic testament, the reader is invited to ponder the complexities of free will, the allure of the forbidden, and the enduring consequences of our actions.

Encompassing an area of nearly 653,000 square kilometers, this country is enveloped by a tapestry of neighboring nations: Iran to the west, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan to the north, and Pakistan to the east and south. Its landscape, a dramatic interplay of towering mountains and arid plains, bears the indelible imprint of its position within the Iranian highlands.\n\nDominating Afghanistan's topography is the majestic Hindu Kush mountain system, its snow-capped peaks piercing the azure sky. This formidable mountain range, an extension of the Himalayas, acts as a natural barrier, dividing the country into distinct regions. To the north, nestled between the towering peaks, lies the fertile Bactrian Plain, a region blessed with alluvial soil deposited by the Amu Darya River.\n\nAfghanistan's climate, characterized as subtropical continental, is heavily influenced by its mountainous terrain and the seasonal monsoon winds. Summers are typically scorching and arid, while winters, though generally mild, bring a sharp drop in temperature, particularly in the eastern highlands. Precipitation, primarily in the form of rain, graces the land during the winter and spring months, offering a brief respite from the aridity.\n\nThe country's river systems, originating from the snowmelt of the Hindu Kush, flow radially outward, their waters a lifeline in this arid land. However, these rivers, lacking underwater connections to larger bodies of water, are susceptible to surface evaporation, their precious water vanishing under the intense sun. This geographical quirk further exacerbates the challenges posed by the arid climate.\n\nAfghanistan's flora, shaped by its arid climate and mountainous terrain, reflects a dominance of hardy, drought-resistant herbaceous plants. These resilient species, including various cereals and legumes, have adapted to thrive in the harsh conditions, their presence a testament to nature's ability to flourish even in the most challenging of environments. The landscape, though seemingly barren at first glance, reveals a subtle beauty upon closer inspection, a testament to the resilience of life in the face of adversity. \n", "message_type": "send", "user_id": "", "parent_id": null}, {"message_id": "31d664dd-ac7b-41b4-9363-345bf46da99b", "content": "An area of almost 653 thousand square meters, located in the territories of Southwest Asia, historically belongs to the state of Afghanistan. Afghanistan has no access to the sea or the ocean and is adjacent to other states from all sides. Thus, the country’s western borders are connected with Iran and Turkmenistan; to the north, it is adjacent to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. On the southeastern side, Afghanistan is entirely bordered by Pakistan from the Gulf of Oman. Notably, the entire area of the state is located in the Iranian highlands, so much of the region is represented by mountainous and hilly terrain (Allchin, 2021). The Hindu Kush mountain system is the most represented there, as its hills, up to 7708 meters high, extend from east to west of the country. However, this does not mean that there are no plains there. On the contrary, to the north of the country, close to Tajikistan, Afghanistan has the Bactrian Plain, which contains a unique geographic area in the form of an extension of the clay-sandy Karakum desert. There are also mountainous depressions and valleys along other borders of the country, representing valuable clay and sand resources for the population.\nGeographical reasons fully determine the local climatic conditions, the impact of which is clearly visible in the Afghan vegetation. Thus, the climate there is typical subtropical continental, with the predominance of monsoon winds. In the summertime, the weather is usually hot and dry, but the local conditions rarely become cold with the onset of winter. Afghan summer temperatures can reach 122 ℉ while temperatures rarely drop below freezing in January (Allchin, 2021). While winters on the eastern side of Afghanistan are primarily cold, closer to the north and south, temperatures tend to be more comfortable and warmer. Most of the rainfall occurs during the winter and spring. At the same time, all river systems and lakes present in Afghanistan are brainless. This means that there is no system of underwater connections, and any flow of water is mainly related to its surface evaporation. As a consequence of a combination of climatic and geographic factors, the local flora is mainly characterized by aridity. Desert landscapes of the country, uniquely combined with mountainous terrain, give the country a large number of herbaceous plants, including cereals, legumes, and other flowering crops.", "message_type": "receive", "user_id": "", "parent_id": null}], "custom": {"id": "8ebe1282-71b1-11ef-a77a-80615f12b4cc_fake_mc"}}

The rustling leaves whispered tales of his bravery while the twigs bent under the weight of his silent steps, as if nature itself conspired to keep his endeavor concealed.\n\nMeanwhile, amidst the grove, the Scarecrow, with his earnest yet awkward demeanor, was engaged in a simpler task.

Each clumsy grasp, every missed nut that tumbled to the ground, was met with peals of laughter from Dorothy, her eyes sparkling with mirth and a heart full of warmth for her endearing friend.\n\nAs twilight descended, and the chill of the evening sent shivers through the air, a flickering flame danced merrily, casting long shadows that played upon the forest floor.

A classic structure of PM-type OPDs is based on the active layer of P3HT:PC70BM with the weight ratio of 100:1, in which PC70BM forms islands and supply bulk electron traps for inducing strong interfacial band bending and thus hole tunneling from the Al electrode. In this paper, aiming for optimizing the PM effect, we study the photogenerated carrier distribution by tuning thickness of the active layer (P3HT:PC70BM). The combination effect of both the exciton generation and exciton dissociation processes affects the photogenerated carrier distribution, which ultimately determines the PM performances of OPDs. On the one hand, simulation reveals that the thinner the active layer, the stronger exciton generation near the Al electrode. On the other hand, the photoluminescence and surface morphology studies reflect that the active layer with thickness of 230 nm has the smooth surface and produces the highest exciton dissociation rate. The two effects result in the OPD with a 205 nm thick active layer has the champion EQE (105569%) and photoresponsivity (344 A/W), corresponding to an enhancement of 330% with respect to the OPD with a 325 nm thick active layer. Ascribed to the trade off of EQE and dark current, the detectivity performs differently at different wavelength ranges. At short wavelength range, the detectivity reaches the highest when the active layer is 205 nm thick, while the highest detectivity at long wavelength range is produced by the thickest active layer. Our work contributes to developing low cost organic photodetectors for detecting weak light signals.", "message_type": "send", "user_id": "", "parent_id": null}, {"message_id": "c3fedf0b-9553-4864-b91c-3aa1f416c195", "content": "This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the optimization of the trap-assisted photomultiplication (PM) effect in organic photodetectors (OPDs) through the modulation of the active layer thickness. The active layer, composed of P3HT:PC70BM, was systematically varied to determine its impact on device performance. Our findings reveal that an active layer thickness of 205 nm yielded the most exceptional results, with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 105569% and a photoresponsivity of 344 A/W. This optimized thickness facilitates enhanced exciton generation in proximity to the Al electrode and maximizes the exciton dissociation rate, crucial for superior device performance. Furthermore, our study underscores the wavelength-dependent nature of OPD detectivity. The 205 nm active layer demonstrated the highest detectivity at short wavelengths, while the thickest active layer exhibited optimal performance at longer wavelengths. These insights provide a strategic pathway for the development of low-cost, high-sensitivity OPDs, particularly beneficial for applications requiring the detection of weak light signals.

While the majority, 22 projects, have acquiesced to the order, the China Three Gorges Project Corporation appears steadfast, sparking concerns over potential ecological consequences and the precedence this defiance might set.\n\nRumors are circulating that rather than halting construction, the corporation is weighing the option of paying fines as a means to continue its work. This strategy, if pursued, could set a disturbing trend among other developers, potentially undermining the efficacy of environmental protection measures enforced by the government.\n\nEnvironmental activists and watchdogs have expressed alarm at this development, emphasizing the need for rigorous adherence to environmental standards in a country that has seen rapid industrialization and infrastructure expansion at the cost of significant natural habitat loss and pollution. They argue that the long-term health of China's ecosystems and the wellbeing of local communities should not be sacrificed for short-term economic gains.\n\nThe government now faces a critical decision: whether to enforce its directive strictly, potentially through more severe penalties or legal action against non-compliant corporations like the China Three Gorges Project Corporation, or risk undermining public trust in its ability to enforce environmental regulations effectively.

For it seemed, by what the Brachmine had told us, that to reach the Moratty army by the shortest way we must needs pass through a rugged country, extreme difficult to traverse with such a train as ours, while the other way, where there was a good road enough, should occupy us still two or three days.

But telling this to Loll Duss, who was making ready where we should lie that night, he showed himself prodigiously concerned, and entreated with much respect that we would allow him to make a certain proposition to us. Which we permitting, he begged of us to leave our train in his care, both the men and all the beasts, that he might conduct it to the camp of Seva Gi by the longer road, while we, the viscount and I, rid on without encumbrance by the short way. It went to his heart (said the honest fellow) that we should be left without the attendance suited to our quality, but by submitting to this trifling inconvenience we should be secure of regaining in the space of a few days all our goods, in the stead of being compelled to undertake the rest of our journey without ’em.

'Do we risk the short path with our cumbersome train, or take the longer, safer route and face the uncertainty of Cogia Bux?' His voice was measured, but the underlying tension was palpable.\n\nHis friend frowned, tracing the outline of a route on the table's rough surface. 'Our goods are precious, no doubt, but we're pinned between the devil and the deep blue sea. Abandoning them to take the short route doesn't sit well with me either.'\n\nJust then, Loll Duss, the wily strategist of their party, stepped forward, a contemplative look in his eyes. 'Gentlemen, may I propose a middle ground?' he began, drawing their attention. \n\n'And what might that be?' the speaker asked cautiously, his skepticism evident.\n\n'Let me take the train via the longer route. I know the terrain well and can avoid Cogia Bux's patrols. Meanwhile, you both can travel light through the short path. We'll reconvene at the rendezvous point near the Moratty army.' Loll Duss laid out his plan with confident precision, tapping the table for emphasis.\n\nThe speaker and his friend exchanged glances, weighing the risks and rewards. Loll Duss’s proposal was not without merit; his intimate knowledge of the area was an asset. \n\n'I believe this might be our best course of action,' the friend finally said, a glint of hope in his eyes.

While an appeal has been formally lodged, skepticism prevails about the possibility of an overturned verdict or even a reduced sentence. \n\nWang's mother, who played a significant role in his defense, expressed profound pessimism regarding the appeal's outcome. \"I don't hold much hope,\" she confessed, her voice heavy with the weight of her son's predicament. However, she refuses to relinquish all hope, instead channeling her energy into a heartfelt plea for international intervention.\n\nWith high-profile figures like U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and German President Roman Herzog scheduled to visit China in the coming weeks, Wang's mother sees a crucial opportunity. She implored both leaders to leverage their diplomatic standing and address her son's case directly with Chinese authorities.\n\nDespite the appeal, experts concur that the odds are stacked against Wang Dan. His case has become emblematic of China's unwavering stance on dissent, a stance seemingly impervious to international pressure. \n\nThe verdict has triggered a wave of condemnation from various corners of the globe. Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson, during a recent meeting with Chinese officials, explicitly voiced his disapproval of the sentencing. The international community, it seems, is struggling to reconcile China's economic rise with its seemingly unyielding grip on political freedom.\n\nHowever, the Chinese government remains steadfast in its position, maintaining that the Wang Dan case falls strictly within its internal affairs. Chinese officials have repeatedly asserted that human rights concerns should not be used as a pretext for foreign interference, effectively drawing a line in the sand against external pressure.\n\nAs the world watches, the fate of Wang Dan hangs precariously in the balance. The upcoming appeal will serve as a litmus test, not only for Wang Dan's personal freedom, but also for the broader relationship between China and the international community, particularly on the sensitive issue of human rights. \n", "message_type": "send", "user_id": "", "parent_id": null}, {"message_id": "30e55219-3ffb-44b4-9253-203bf59447f4", "content": "Chinese dissident Wang Dan has appealed against his 11-year jail sentence for plotting to subvert the government, but his mother said on Tuesday she held little hope of an acquittal or a lighter sentence.\nWang Lingyun said she hoped U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and German President Roman Herzog would raise her son's predicament in their meetings with Chinese leaders when they visit China later this month.\n\"Wang Dan... should be acquitted because... he's innocent,\" she told Reuters by telephone. \"We hope for an acquittal or a reduced sentence... but it is unlikely.\"\nWang Lingyun, who acted as one of two defence lawyers in her son's case, said court officials had asked her to submit a written defence for the appeal and that family members may not be allowed to attend the appeals court trial.\nExperts on China's legal system have said the chances of the appeals court overturning the lower court's verdict were slim.\nAn official of the Beijing Higher People's Court said the 27-year-old dissident had filed his appeal. She declined to provide further details.\nThe Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court took less than four hours last Wednesday to convict and sentence Wang, who had already served four years in prison for his role as a leader of the 1989 student demonstrations for democracy that were crushed by the military with heavy loss of life.\nOn Monday, visiting Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson said he had expressed his disapproval to Chinese Premier Li Peng over the jailing of Wang.\nA foreign ministry spokesman defended China at a news briefing on Tuesday, saying Beijing would not impose its laws on others and that foreign countries should take a similar stance.\nThe spokesman also said China opposed using human rights as a pretext to interfere in the internal affairs of any country.\nAn international human rights group denounced what it said was the \"secret trial\" of Wang on a trumped-up charge.", "message_type": "receive", "user_id": "", "parent_id": null}], "custom": {"id": "8ebea918-71b1-11ef-a77a-80615f12b4cc_fake_mc"}}

According to recent statistics, the country witnessed over 50,000 deaths related to opioid abuse in 2019 alone, translating to a substantial economic burden of $78.5 billion annually. The severity of this crisis has prompted key stakeholders, including local policymakers, community leaders, medical staff, and reputable organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), to come together in search of solutions.\n\nAt the forefront of these efforts are the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which have identified several core strategies to combat the opioid crisis. Firstly, improving access to treatment and recovery services is crucial in addressing addiction and supporting individuals on their path to recovery. This involves not only increasing the availability of these services but also ensuring they are accessible to all segments of the population, particularly those in underserved communities.\n\nAnother vital strategy is promoting the use of overdose-preventive drugs, such as naloxone, which can save lives by reversing opioid overdoses if administered promptly. To effectively deploy these interventions, enhancing healthcare surveillance is necessary for better data collection and analysis. This will enable policymakers and healthcare professionals to track the crisis's progression, identify areas of high risk, and tailor their responses accordingly.\n\nMoreover, supporting research on pain management is crucial in the fight against opioid addiction. Many individuals are introduced to opioids through prescriptions for pain management, highlighting the need for alternative pain reduction methods. By investing in research and development of non-opioid pain treatments, we can reduce the reliance on opioids and prevent new cases of addiction.\n\nFinally, the role of communities in addressing the opioid crisis cannot be overstated. By staying informed, involved, and proactive, community members can contribute significantly to the efforts against opioid addiction. This includes supporting local initiatives, advocating for policy changes, and fostering a culture of understanding and support for those affected by the crisis.

The cases of teenage pregnancy started in Kenya after the country-wide school closure that started from March 2020 and lasted until January 2021. Zulaika (2022) examine to what extent the pandemic affected sexual and reproductive health of adolescents in Rarieda subcounty. The study shows there was a limited involvement of health administrators on the issue of pregnancy among school girls. Teenagers lack sexual education and are not aware of different methods of protection. Health administrators should find this issue important as early pregnancy can be dangerous for girls’ health and lead to various socio-economic problems in the future. Moreover, if such a rate of adolescent pregnancy continues to increase, there would be less educated females in Kenya. Zulaika (2022) also mentions that stress level of pregnant teenagers is high, affecting mental as well as physical health of young future mothers. To tackle this issue, Zulaika (2022) suggests implementing population-level emergencies on girls that are going to school. Students should be educated for the basics of sexual education and for the side effects of sexual life. Furthermore, the article points out that infectious diseases can be spread rapidly if school girls do not know the importance of contraceptives. As such, there is a need to the national project of informing school students and their parents about sexual and reproductive issues. The effects of COVID-19 on teenage pregnancy are negative, causing additional social and economic problems not only for the pregnant girls and their families but also for the whole country.", "message_type": "send", "user_id": "", "parent_id": null}, {"message_id": "77747430-82e8-433f-a0d9-646ee04a5a5c", "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching consequences beyond the realm of public health, with its impact on education and social structures being acutely felt worldwide. In the specific context of Kenya's Rarieda subcounty, Zulaika's (2022) study sheds light on a disturbing trend: the surge in adolescent pregnancies among secondary school girls following the imposition of lockdown measures from March 2020 to January 2021. This phenomenon, which can be attributed to a glaring gap in sexual education and limited access to information on contraceptives among青少年, underscores the collateral damage inflicted by the pandemic on vulnerable populations.\n\nThe lack of intervention by health administrators in addressing this issue is alarming, given the multifaceted repercussions it holds for both the young mothers and their communities. Adolescent pregnancies often lead to school dropouts, thereby truncating the educational and career prospects of these girls. This, in turn, perpetuates a cycle of poverty and hinders the socio-economic development of the region. Moreover, inadequate attention to reproductive health heightens the risk of maternal and child health complications, placing additional strain on an already overburdened healthcare system.\n\nZulaika's findings emphasize the criticality of national-level strategies that aim to educate students and their parents comprehensively about sexual and reproductive health. Such initiatives could serve as a bulwark against further escalations in teenage pregnancies and school dropout rates, ultimately safeguarding the future of Kenya's youth. By empowering adolescents with knowledge and resources, society can foster an environment where informed decisions about sexual health are made, reducing unwanted pregnancies and their attendant adversities.\n\nFurthermore, the study alludes to the heightened stress levels experienced by pregnant teenagers, which exact a toll on their mental and physical wellbeing. In this light, sexual education assumes an even greater significance as a means to alleviate anxiety, promote self-care, and encourage timely medical support for pregnant adolescents. It's also noteworthy that effective sexuality education contributes to curbing the transmission of sexually transmitted infections, thereby safeguarding public health more broadly.\n\nIn conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has ruthlessly exposed and exacerbated existing vulnerabilities within Kenyan society, particularly in terms of adolescent reproductive health. The rise in teenage pregnancies and school dropouts amidst lockdowns highlights the dire need for targeted interventions centered around comprehensive sexual education. These measures are instrumental in mitigating the pandemic's damaging effects on the younger generation and ensuring a healthier, more equitable future for Kenya. National and local authorities must prioritize investments in sexual and reproductive health education to counteract the detrimental consequences witnessed during this unprecedented crisis.", "message_type": "receive", "user_id": "", "parent_id": null}], "custom": {"id": "8ebe2c04-71b1-11ef-a77a-80615f12b4cc_fake_mc"}}

In particular, one of the methods for extracting highly viscous bitumen grades of oil from the subterranean depths is based on the dilution of the contents of the porous medium by means of pumping coolants. The simplest and environmentally friendly coolant is wet steam containing small drops of water. In addition, with the help of heated water vapour, the filtering elements of collectors are cleaned from sediments of the solid phase (for example, paraffins, gas hydrates and ice floes) on the walls of the porous medium. For realistic modeling of the processes of filtration and heat and mass transfer during the injection of wet steam into a porous medium, it is necessary to investigate the characteristics of the interaction of saturated water vapour with individual through-type pores. In this paper, a study was carried out through mathematical modelling of the dependence of the diffusion rate of wet water vapour on the pressure difference outside the pore that occurs when water vapour is injected into a porous medium. The dependencies of the diffusion rate on the pore cross section, the magnitude of vapour adsorption on the pore walls, as well as the effect of water vapour temperature on all these processes were also investigated. Practical interest is the study of the influence of the rate of cooling of water vapour on the diffusion rate and the adsorption of water vapour on the wall of the pores. The calculations were carried out using a hybrid type model that combines molecular dynamics and macro-diffusion approaches to describe the interaction of water vapour with individual pores.", "message_type": "send", "user_id": "", "parent_id": null}, {"message_id": "bd70574a-12c3-497b-9916-b5d0019442a4", "content": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of wet water vapour transport, with significant implications for diverse sectors such as construction, mining, agriculture, and environmental safety. The primary focus is the innovative application of wet steam to dilute highly viscous bitumen grades of oil and to clean filtering elements within porous media. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, a sophisticated mathematical model is developed to examine how the diffusion rate of wet water vapour is influenced by various factors, including pressure difference, pore cross-section, vapour adsorption, and temperature.\n\nA central theme of the research is the critical role played by the cooling rates of water vapour in governing diffusion and adsorption processes. To comprehensively capture these phenomena, a hybrid model is employed that seamlessly integrates molecular dynamics simulations with macro-diffusion approaches. This dual-pronged methodology enables a detailed exploration of both microscopic and macroscopic aspects of wet water vapour transport, providing valuable insights into the complex interplay between different parameters.\n\nThe findings of this study have the potential to revolutionize industrial practices by offering enhanced efficiency and sustainability in the management of viscous oils and the maintenance of porous media.

Now this design, although called Fate when looked upon as the compelling force of a cause, the laws of whose operation are unknown to us, is, when considered as the purpose manifested in the course of nature, called Providence, as the deeplying wisdom of a Higher Cause, directing itself towards the ultimate practical end of the human race and predetermining the course of things with a view to its realisation. This Providence we do not, it is true, perceive in the cunning contrivances of nature; nor can we even conclude from the fact of their existence that it is there; but, as in every relation between the form of things and their final cause, we can, and must, supply the thought of a Higher Wisdom, in order that we may be able to form an idea of the possible existence of these products after the analogy of human works of art. The representation to ourselves of the relation and agreement of these formations of nature to the moral purpose for which they were made and which reason directly prescribes to us, is an Idea, it is true, which is in theory superfluous; but in practice it is dogmatic, and its objective reality is well established. Thus we see, for example, with regard to the ideal of perpetual peace, that it is our duty to make use of the mechanism of nature for the realisation of that end. Moreover, in a case like this where we are interested merely in the theory and not in the religious question, the use of the word “nature” is more appropriate than that of “providence”, in view of the limitations of human reason, which, in considering the relation of effects to their causes, must keep within the limits of possible experience. And the term “nature” is also less presumptuous than the other. To speak of a Providence knowable by us would be boldly to put on the wings of Icarus in order to draw near to the mystery of its unfathomable purpose.", "message_type": "send", "user_id": "", "parent_id": null}, {"message_id": "974ed743-f148-4d57-9c65-b5b1f3beded4", "content": "In contemplating the intricate tapestry of human existence, we are often struck by the apparent discord and chaos that seems to permeate our collective experience. Yet, beneath this tumultuous surface, there lies a subtle, guiding force that weaves order from disorder, harmony from dissonance. This force, which we might call nature, operates with a mysterious efficiency that both confounds and inspires the human intellect.\n\nWhen we observe the workings of nature, we are presented with two possible interpretations of its essence. On one hand, we may view it as Fate – an inexorable, albeit inscrutable, power that compels events towards certain outcomes. This perspective imbues nature with a sense of inevitability, yet leaves us grappling with the unsettling notion of an unknowable cause steering the course of human affairs.\n\nAlternatively, we might conceive of nature as Providence – a higher wisdom that orchestrates the grand symphony of existence towards a purposeful end for humanity. This view offers a more comforting narrative, suggesting that the apparent chaos we perceive is but a temporary state en route to a greater, more harmonious design.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to acknowledge that we do not directly perceive Providence in the machinations of nature. Our limited faculties of perception and reason cannot fully grasp the totality of nature's workings. Instead, we must engage our imagination to conceive of a higher wisdom that aligns nature's processes with moral purposes. This act of imagination is not mere fantasy, but a necessary bridge between our finite understanding and the infinite complexity of the natural world.\n\nThe concept of perpetual peace serves as an exemplar of how we might harness nature's mechanisms towards lofty moral ends. By recognizing the patterns and tendencies inherent in nature, we can work in concert with these forces to cultivate a state of lasting harmony among humanity. This approach does not seek to subjugate nature to human will, but rather to align our aspirations with the underlying currents of natural order.\n\nFrom a theoretical standpoint, it is more prudent to employ the term 'nature' rather than 'providence' when discussing these matters. This preference stems from two key considerations. First, it acknowledges the limitations of human reason in comprehending the full scope of existence. Second, it guards against the presumption of claiming definitive knowledge about the ultimate purpose or design of the universe.\n\nIn embracing the concept of nature as our guiding principle, we adopt a stance of humble inquiry rather than dogmatic assertion. We recognize our place within the vast tapestry of existence, neither insignificant nor supreme, but intricately connected to the whole. This perspective invites us to work in harmony with the natural order, striving to achieve our highest aspirations while remaining cognizant of the greater forces at play in the universe.", "message_type": "receive", "user_id": "", "parent_id": null}], "custom": {"id": "8ebe3c94-71b1-11ef-a77a-80615f12b4cc_fake_mc"}}

It is acknowledged on all hands, says that learned prelate, that the authority, either of the scripture or of tradition, is founded merely in the testimony of the apostles, who were eye-witnesses to those miracles of our Saviour, by which he proved his divine mission. Our evidence, then, for the truth of the Christian religion is less than the evidence for the truth of our senses; because, even in the first authors of our religion, it was no greater; and it is evident it must diminish in passing from them to their disciples; nor can any one rest such confidence in their testimony, as in the immediate object of his senses. But a weaker evidence can never destroy a stronger; and therefore, were the doctrine of the real presence ever so clearly revealed in scripture, it were directly contrary to the rules of just reasoning to give our assent to it. It contradicts sense, though both the scripture and tradition, on which it is supposed to be built, carry not such evidence with them as sense; when they are considered merely as external evidences, and are not brought home to every one's breast, by the immediate operation of the Holy Spirit.", "message_type": "send", "user_id": "", "parent_id": null}, {"message_id": "db6d0c84-c76b-46cc-a4a2-da32297532d0", "content": "## The Unseen Feast: A Question of Sense and Scripture\n\nThe venerable Dr. Tillotson, in his treatise against the doctrine of the real presence, presents a compelling argument rooted in the very foundation of religious belief: the nature of evidence. He posits that both scripture and tradition, the twin pillars of religious authority, ultimately rest upon the testimony of the apostles, those who walked and talked with Christ. Their words, passed down through generations, form the bedrock of faith.\n\nHowever, Tillotson astutely observes that even this sacred testimony, powerful as it may be, pales in comparison to the immediacy of our own senses. We trust our eyes when they perceive the world, our ears when they register sounds. This sensory experience is direct, unmediated, and forms the very basis of our understanding of reality. To deny its validity, Tillotson argues, is to cast doubt on the very foundation of knowledge itself.\n\nApplying this principle to the Eucharist, Tillotson contends that the doctrine of the real presence, which asserts the actual transformation of bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ, directly contradicts our sensory experience. We see bread, we taste bread; our senses offer no indication of any miraculous transformation.  While scripture may indeed pronounce the reality of this transubstantiation, Tillotson argues that relying on testimony passed down through time cannot supersede the immediacy and certainty of our own senses.\n\nThis argument strikes at the heart of how we reconcile faith and reason. If our senses, the tools by which we comprehend the physical world, are to be doubted in the face of scriptural pronouncements, then on what grounds can any empirical observation stand against the weight of religious dogma?  Tillotson’s argument, therefore, is not merely a theological debate about the Eucharist; it is a profound inquiry into the limits of faith and the nature of evidence itself. \n", "message_type": "receive", "user_id": "", "parent_id": null}], "custom": {"id": "8ebdf766-71b1-11ef-a77a-80615f12b4cc_fake_mc"}}

These results, our second best interim results ever, show we can remain independent,\" a Robert Fleming spokesman told Reuters.\nFlemings has been widely talked about as a possible takeover target for a larger foreign investment bank, but has resolutely said it would retain its independence.\nFlemings said its pretax profit for the first half of the year had increased by 16 percent to 92.2 million pounds ($154 million), from 79.4 million pounds a year earlier but warned it would have to cope with difficult markets in the second half.\nSome analysts said the increase was not particularly impressive given market conditions but chief executive John Manser said it was \"a very good start\" and showed new businesses were \"making a valuable contribution to profitability.\"\n\"While the outlook for the year seems promising, flat Asian markets and heightened competitive pressures in other markets are factors that we will continue to have to contend with during the next six months,\" Manser said in a statement.\nThe Flemings official said the results showed that while Flemings may have been perceived as an Asian-centric bank, it was now a much more international operation and had succeeded in bringing down its cost income ratio.\nFlemings has not had an easy year so far. In July it lost investment banking head Bill Harrison who was poached by BZW, the investment banking arm of Britain's Barclays.\nAnd in August Jardine Fleming, a joint venture with Jardine Matheson, revealed a five-month probe by British and Hong Kong regulators into irregular trades by a former senior fund manager at Jardine Fleming Investment Management.\nThis resulted in hefty fines and voluntary compensation of nearly $20 million to clients.

Despite facing an array of challenges and being at the center of acquisition speculation, the esteemed institution has reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining its independent status, underlining its confidence in navigating the rough seas of global finance.\n\nCEO John Manser, in acknowledging the promising start to the fiscal year and the fruitful contributions from recently incorporated business ventures, struck a cautiously optimistic tone. He emphasized that while the bank's expansion into new areas has bolstered its financial performance, the road ahead is fraught with complexities, particularly in the rapidly evolving Asian markets and amid加剧的竞争 pressures in more established territories.\n\nThe Asian market, once seen as a beacon of growth for Robert Fleming, has become increasingly unpredictable due to economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions. Manser's remarks reflect the bank's awareness of the need for agility and strategic foresight amidst these trying conditions. Additionally, the bank faces stiff competition from both traditional players and emerging fintech firms, which are reshaping the industry landscape with their innovative offerings and streamlined services.\n\nCompounding these external challenges, Robert Fleming has also had to grapple with internal upheavals. The unexpected departure of its investment banking head constituted a significant blow, disrupting the bank's leadership structure at a critical juncture. Furthermore, regulatory issues plaguing its joint venture, Jardine Fleming, resulted in substantial fines and necessitated compensation payouts to clients, denting both the bank's finances and reputation.\n\nIn response to these setbacks, the bank has embarked on a comprehensive internal restructuring initiative aimed at reinforcing governance and restoring investor confidence. A pivotal measure in this overhaul is the establishment of a new supervisory board.

Prior to Kant's revolutionary insights, the prevailing wisdom held that all a priori knowledge was inherently analytic in nature. This perspective posited that such knowledge consisted solely of propositions wherein the predicate was merely a component of the subject, exemplified by statements like \"A bald man is a man.\" These analytic judgments, while logically incontrovertible, were often deemed trivial and seldom explicitly articulated outside of rhetorical contexts.\n\nThe presumption that all a priori knowledge adhered to this pattern led to a narrowly defined epistemological landscape. It suggested that any attempt to deny such knowledge would inevitably result in logical contradiction, thereby reinforcing its perceived infallibility. This view, however, imposed significant limitations on our understanding of the potential scope and depth of a priori knowledge.\n\nKant's critical philosophy would later challenge this entrenched notion, introducing the concept of synthetic a priori knowledge. This paradigm shift opened new avenues for exploring the foundations of human understanding, expanding our conception of what can be known independently of experience while still contributing meaningful content to our knowledge.

Such propositions as the above are trivial, and would never be enunciated in real life except by an orator preparing the way for a piece of sophistry. They are called 'analytic' because the predicate is obtained by merely analysing the subject. Before the time of Kant it was thought that all judgements of which we could be certain a priori were of this kind: that in all of them there was a predicate which was only part of the subject of which it was asserted.

Binding the Sovereign to itself through public deliberation would be tantamount to an individual making a contract with oneself—a nonsensical proposition. Consequently, fundamental laws, including the sacrosanct social contract, do not possess the power to constrain the Sovereign.

But, in the light of the concept, my right to a thing is not merely possession, but as possession by a person it is property, or legal possession, and it is a duty to possess things as property, i.e. to be as a person. Translated into the phenomenal relationship, viz. relation to another person—this grows into the duty of some one else to respect my right. In the morality of the conscience, duty in general is in me—a free subject—at the same time a right of my subjective will or disposition. But in this individualist moral sphere, there arises the division between what is only inward purpose (disposition or intention), which only has its being in me and is merely subjective duty, and the actualisation of that purpose: and with this division a contingency and imperfection which makes the inadequacy of mere individualistic morality. In social ethics these two parts have reached their truth, their absolute unity; although even right and duty return to one another and combine by means of certain adjustments and under the guise of necessity. The rights of the father of the family over its members are equally duties towards them; just as the children's duty of obedience is their right to be educated to the liberty of manhood. The penal judicature of a government, its rights of administration, &c., are no less its duties to punish, to administer, &c.; as the services of the members of the State in dues, military services, &c., are duties and yet their right to the protection of their private property and of the general substantial life in which they have their root. All the aims of society and the State are the private aim of the individuals. But the set of adjustments, by which their duties come back to them as the exercise and enjoyment of right, [pg 106]produces an appearance of diversity: and this diversity is increased by the variety of shapes which value assumes in the course of exchange, though it remains intrinsically the same. Still it holds fundamentally good that he who has no rights has no duties and vice versa.", "message_type": "send", "user_id": "", "parent_id": null}, {"message_id": "f601283f-df48-48d4-9e9f-5ff00aa02068", "content": "The intricate web of human relationships is woven from the threads of rights and duties, each strand inextricably linked to the other. A right, by its very nature, implies a corresponding duty for another individual. This symbiotic relationship extends beyond the realm of mere ownership, encompassing the legal possession of property and the duty to recognize and respect that ownership.\n\nIn the moral landscape of individual conscience, duty takes on a dual role. It is both an internal obligation, a whisper of the subjective will, and a right that is inextricably tied to one's own sense of self. However, this individualistic morality is imperfect, for it is often torn asunder by the chasm between intention and action. The best of intentions can falter, and the noblest of duties can be left unfulfilled.\n\nYet, in the sphere of social ethics, rights and duties converge in a harmonious union. Within the context of families and states, this unity is palpable. Parental authority, for instance, is a right that is inextricably linked to the duty of providing care and guidance. Governments, in turn, have a duty to administer justice, while citizens have a corresponding duty to contribute to the state, which in turn ensures their rights and freedoms.\n\nAt first glance, societal structures may appear to create a complex tapestry of varied rights and duties. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that these rights and duties are fundamentally intertwined. One cannot exist without the other, and the apparent disparity is merely a reflection of the intricate web of relationships that underlies human society.\n\nIn this sense, rights and duties are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary facets of a single, unified whole. The exercise of one's rights is, in itself, a duty, for it implies a responsibility to respect and uphold the rights of others. Conversely, the fulfillment of one's duties is, in itself, a right, for it ensures the continued existence and well-being of the social fabric.

This is not about returning to a pre-industrial past, but about advancing into a future where nature and technology coexist and collaborate.\n\nImagine cities that breathe, where buildings are not just structures, but living, green entities that purify the air. Imagine industries that thrive not at the expense of our environment, but in harmony with it. Imagine a world where economic growth is not a sentence of doom for our planet, but a path to its salvation.\n\nThis is the future we must strive for. This is the new environmentalism. This is our challenge, our duty, and our destiny. Let us not shy away from it, but embrace it with every fiber of our being.

The dish made its way to this region through waves of Chinese migration. Traditionally, Mu krop is a Cantonese-style crispy pork, characterized by its marination in Five-spice powder and grilling over high heat to achieve a crispy texture.\n\nHowever, the Thai version of Mu krop underwent distinct transformations, especially during Thailand's Ayutthaya period. In its Thai incarnation, the dish utilizes pork belly that is baked until it becomes dry and crispy on the outside while retaining a soft interior. The rinds of the pork develop a shiny, golden brown appearance and a crunchy texture that is highly prized.\n\nOne of the key differences between the original Cantonese Mu krop and the Thai adaptation is the exclusion of Five-spice powder in the latter. In Thailand, an additional frying step is incorporated for made-to-order preparations. This step enhances the crispiness and adds a unique dimension to the dish’s texture and flavor profile.\n\nDespite these changes, the dish has retained its popularity due to its appealing combination of textures and flavors. The Thai version of Mu krop holds a special place in the country’s culinary traditions, showcasing how a dish can evolve and adapt while maintaining its essence.\n\nMu krop continues to be a sought-after dish in Thailand, enjoyed by locals and visitors alike.

The original Siu yuk is cooked using the method of marinating Five-spice powder before grilling large pieces of pork belly over high heat for several hours until the pork is cooked throughout. This maintains a thick layer of fat and keeps the rind crispy with a faint scent of spices.\nWhen mu krop was introduced to Thailand during the Ayutthaya period, the cooking method developed slightly differently and the pork belly was baked until it was dry and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. In this era, crispy pork was considered an interesting menu item and became very popular in the Thai food market. In the present day, crispy pork continues to gain high popularity. This is a result of the delicious characteristic of shiny golden brown, crispy and crunchy rinds with layers of soft, tender and juicy fat and chewy meat, and the aroma from the mixed seasonings. The crispiness comes from the large amount of porosity and complete dryness on the pork belly's surface along with the consistently high heat temperature, which helps air penetrate the skin layer better. However, unlike the Cantonese style crispy pork, mu krop lacks the spice powder in the original recipe. This evolved as Thai restaurants cooked the meat again in hot frying oil for made-to-order restaurants, rendering the prior seasonings useless.", "message_type": "receive", "user_id": "", "parent_id": null}], "custom": {"id": "8ebe972a-71b1-11ef-a77a-80615f12b4cc_fake_mc"}}

The project of the dukedom of Drownedland is given chief place, and attention is centred upon it both here and in the following scenes. Little use, however, is made of it in the motivation of action. This is left for another project, the office of the Master of Dependencies (quarrels) in the next act. This device is introduced in an incidental way, and we are not prepared for the important place which it takes in the development of the plot. Merecraft, goaded by Everill, hits upon it merely as a temporary makeshift to extort money from Fitzdottrel. The latter determines to make use of the office in prosecuting his quarrel with Wittipol. In preparation for the duel, and in accordance with the course of procedure laid down by Everill, he resolves to settle his estate. Merecraft and Everill endeavor to have the deed drawn in their own favor, but through the interference of Wittipol the whole estate is made over to Manly, who restores it to Mrs. Fitzdottrel. This project becomes then the real turning-point of the play. The episode of Guilthead and Plutarchus in Act 3 is only slightly connected with the main plot. That of Wittipol’s disguise as a Spanish lady, touched upon in the first two acts, becomes the chief interest of the fourth. It furnishes much comic material, and the characters of Lady Tailbush and Lady Eitherside offer the poet the opportunity for some of his cleverest touches in characterization and contrast. The scene, however, is introduced for incidental purposes, the satirization of foreign fashions and the follies of London society, and is overelaborated. The catalogue of cosmetics is an instance of Jonson’s intimate acquaintance with recondite knowledge standing in the way of his art. Merecraft’s ‘after game’ in the fifth act is of the nature of an appendix. The play might well have ended with the frustration of his plan to get possession of the estate. This act is introduced chiefly for the sake of a satire upon pretended demoniacs and witch-finders. It also contains the conclusion of the devil-plot. The Devil is an Ass will always remain valuable as a historical document, and as a record of Jonson’s own attitude towards the abuses of his times. In the treatment of Fitzdottrel and Merecraft among the chief persons, and of Plutarchus Guilthead among the lesser, this play belongs to Jonson’s character-drama.It does not, however, belong to the pure humor-comedy. Like The Alchemist, and in marked contrast to Every Man out of his Humor, interest is sought in plot development. In the scene between Lady Tailbush and Lady Eitherside, the play becomes a comedy of manners, and in its attack upon state abuses it is semi-political in nature. Both Gifford and Swinburne have observed the ethical treatment of the main motives.", "message_type": "send", "user_id": "", "parent_id": null}, {"message_id": "b75f1408-90a0-4a4c-9e3b-8fe4760aa798", "content": "In the resplendent theater, the velvet curtains swept aside to reveal the second act, where Merecraft, a man of cunning and deceit, spun his web. His plot, a diversion rather than a driving force, was to ensnare Fitzdottrel with the allure of a nonexistent dukedom—Drownedland, a title as insubstantial as the vapor that rose from the nearby marshes. Yet, this deceit was but a whisper in the wind, a subplot that tickled the audience's fancy without steering the play's course.\n\nThe heart of the drama pulsed with Fitzdottrel's ill-conceived decision. As the Master of Dependencies, a title that inflated his ego like a bullfrog in spring, he sought quarrel with Wittipol, a man of sharper wit and more modest means. The stage echoed with their verbal sparring, each line a thrust and parry, until Fitzdottrel, in a fit of pique, transferred his estate to Manly. This rash act was not the end, but the catalyst, for Manly, a man of honor and clear sight, returned the estate not to Fitzdottrel, but to his long-suffering wife, Mrs. Fitzdottrel. The audience gasped, a ripple of surprise and delight, as the power shifted like sand in an hourglass.\n\nThe fourth act was a whirlwind of color and laughter, a satire that cut as keenly as a sword. Wittipol, disguised as a Spanish lady, minced and preened, a parody of foreign fashions that had the audience roaring. The stage was a mirror, reflecting the follies of society, the absurdities of fashion, and the ridiculous lengths to which people would go to appear au courant. Jonson's pen was a lash, chastising the foolish and the vain, and the audience loved him for it.\n\nAs the play drew to its close, the fifth act presented a satire darker still, a critique of demoniacs, those who feigned possession for gain or pity. It was a stark note, a bitter herb amidst the sweet, yet it served its purpose, wrapping up the devil-plot neatly, like an appendix to the main tale.\n\nThe play, a tapestry of character and plot, was a historical gem, a showcase of Jonson's genius. It was a comedy of manners, a semi-political satire, a critique of societal abuses that had the audience nodding in agreement even as they laughed at the absurdities on stage. Critics would later note its ethical exploration, the way it delved into the main themes of deception, power, and vanity, holding them up to the light for all to see.\n\nAs the curtains swept closed, the audience erupted in applause, their minds whirring with the lessons learned and the laughter shared. The play was not just entertainment; it was a commentary, a critique, a mirror held up to society. And as the echoes of applause faded, the audience stepped out into the night, their hearts a little lighter, their minds a little sharper, and their souls a little wiser for the experience.", "message_type": "receive", "user_id": "", "parent_id": null}], "custom": {"id": "8ebe7ede-71b1-11ef-a77a-80615f12b4cc_fake_mc"}}

It is of that consequence to its other knowledge, that so far as this faculty is in itself dull, or not rightly made use of, for the distinguishing one thing from another,—so far our notions are confused, and our reason and judgment disturbed or misled. If in having our ideas in the memory ready at hand consists quickness of parts; in this, of having them unconfused, and being able nicely to distinguish one thing from another, where there is but the least difference, consists, in a great measure, the exactness of judgment, and clearness of reason, which is to be observed in one man above another. And hence perhaps may be given some reason of that common observation,—that men who have a great deal of wit, and prompt memories, have not always the clearest judgment or deepest reason. For WIT lying most in the assemblage of ideas, and putting those together with quickness and variety, wherein can be found any resemblance or congruity, thereby to make up pleasant pictures and agreeable visions in the fancy; JUDGMENT, on the contrary, lies quite on the other side, in separating carefully, one from another, ideas wherein can be found the least difference, thereby to avoid being misled by similitude, and by affinity to take one thing for another. This is a way of proceeding quite contrary to metaphor and allusion; wherein for the most part lies that entertainment and pleasantry of wit, which strikes so lively on the fancy, and therefore is so acceptable to all people, because its beauty appears at first sight, and there is required no labour of thought to examine what truth or reason there is in it.

At the heart of this predicament lies the inherent limitations of our senses, the lack of mental acuity, and the pitfalls of hastiness. These factors collectively conspire against us, rendering it increasingly difficult to form sound judgments and engage in rigorous reasoning.\n\nThe importance of cultivating this faculty cannot be overstated. It is the cornerstone upon which clear judgment and reasoning are built. However, it is a common misconception that individuals endowed with quick wit and impressive memories are necessarily equipped with the keenest judgment or the deepest understanding. The truth is that wit and judgment are two distinct entities, each operating on different planes.\n\nWit, by its very nature, relies on the swift assembly of agreeable ideas, creating a facade of intellectual prowess that can be deceiving. In contrast, judgment involves the careful separation and discernment of distinct ideas, a more laborious and painstaking process that demands a depth of analysis and critical thinking. The immediate appeal of wit can be seductive, offering a superficial pleasure that is easy to indulge in, but it is a poor substitute for the richness of true understanding that only comes from diligent and searching inquiry.\n\nMoreover, the ease with which we can be swayed by the quick fixes and fleeting gratifications of wit can lead us astray, distracting us from the more profound and satisfying rewards that come from genuine insight and comprehension. True understanding is not a product of hasty assumptions or shallow thinking, but rather the result of a deliberate and systematic effort to engage with the world around us, to question, to probe, and to analyze. It is through this more arduous but ultimately more rewarding process that we may hope to arrive at a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world we inhabit.", "message_type": "receive", "user_id": "", "parent_id": null}], "custom": {"id": "8ebdc638-71b1-11ef-a77a-80615f12b4cc_fake_mc"}}

The air is her encyclopedia, filled with the tales of water and predators, each scent a chapter in the story of survival.\n\nWhat sets elephants apart from the rest of the animal kingdom is their extraordinary commitment to the sense of smell.

In the city of Seville, devout Catholics are turning themselves in to the authorities. They’re confessing to heresy— failure to follow the beliefs of the Catholic Church. But why?The Spanish Inquisition has arrived in Seville. The Inquisition began in 1478, when Pope Sixtus IV issued a decree authorizing the Catholic monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, to root out heresy in the Spanish kingdoms— a confederacy of semi-independent kingdoms in the area that would become the modern country of Spain. Though the order came from the church, the monarchs had requested it. When the Inquisition began, the Spanish kingdoms were diverse both ethnically and religiously, with Jews, Muslims, and Christians living in the same regions. The Inquisition quickly turned its attention to ridding the region of people who were not part of the Catholic Church. It would last more than 350 years.On the ground, groups called tribunals ran the Inquisition in each region.", "message_type": "send", "user_id": "", "parent_id": null}, {"message_id": "a56d3d12-089b-432a-831c-6a1da303de2e", "content": "In 1481, in the city of Seville, a grim reality took hold as devout Catholics found themselves confessing to heresy in a desperate bid to avoid persecution. This was a direct consequence of the Spanish Inquisition, a period of intense religious scrutiny and purging that began in 1478. With the authorization of Pope Sixtus IV, the monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella embarked on a mission to eliminate heresy within their realm. Seville, once a beacon of diversity where Jews, Muslims, and Christians lived harmoniously, became engulfed in fear. The Inquisition sought to purify Spain of non-Catholic elements, a quest that spanned over 350 tumultuous years. Tribunals were established across different regions to manage and operate this relentless drive for religious conformity, forever altering the cultural and social landscape of Spain.", "message_type": "receive", "user_id": "", "parent_id": null}], "custom": {"id": "8ebd3a60-71b1-11ef-a77a-80615f12b4cc_fake_mc"}}
