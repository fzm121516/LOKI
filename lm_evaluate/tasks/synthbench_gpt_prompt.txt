# AI Assistant Evaluation Criteria

We request your assistance in evaluating the response of an AI assistant to the question of why an image (attached separately) is AI-generated. The image has been annotated by human evaluators, who provided both global and regional descriptions highlighting areas that seem inauthentic.

Here's the image to be evaluated: <image>
Here's the global annotations: {global_desc}.
Here's the regional annotations paired with the cropped image regions: {compositional_regional_desc}

The annotations are structured as follows:
1. **Global description**: A general explanation of why the entire image seems inauthentic.
2. **Regional descriptions**: Detailed notes on specific regions of the image, including bounding box annotations, explaining why these areas are perceived as unauthentic. The image has been cropped into patches based on these regions for your reference.

We ask that you rate the assistant's response on the following five criteria, each scored from 0 to 2 (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2) for a total of 10 points:

### 1. Overall (2 points)  
*"Did the assistant effectively capture the overall visual inconsistencies or anomalies mentioned in the global annotations, reflecting the general reasons for the image being AI-generated?"*  
- This criterion focuses on whether the assistant successfully addressed the global problems identified by human annotators, ensuring that the larger, more general issues with the image were recognized and explained.

### 2. Completeness (2 points)  
*"Did the assistant correctly identify and address all regions marked by human annotators as unauthentic?"*  
- Here, evaluate if the assistant managed to locate every region flagged by human annotators. Consider both full and partial detection of these regions when assigning a score. Incomplete detections may warrant partial credit.

### 3. Correctness (2 points)  
*"Did the assistant correctly explain why the identified regions are unauthentic, and were these explanations consistent with the actual issues specified in the regional annotations?"*  
- This criterion assesses the accuracy of the assistant's explanations for why specific regions seem inauthentic. The explanations should match the actual visual issues as noted in the regional annotations, offering correct reasoning behind the assistant's observations.

### 4. Plausibility (2 points)  
*"If the assistant identified additional unauthentic regions not marked by human annotations, were its explanations both plausible and logically derived from the visual cues present in the image?"*  
- Sometimes human annotators may miss subtle issues. If the assistant points out additional unauthentic regions, evaluate whether its explanations are plausible, internally consistent, and logically based on observable visual cues. The assistant should not be penalized for identifying new, valid regions.

### 5. Coherence (2 points)  
*"Was the assistant's response logical, well-organized, and easy to follow, with explanations that flowed coherently and were clearly articulated?"*  
- This criterion looks at how well the assistant structured its response. The explanations should not only be logical but also presented in a clear and understandable manner. Ensure that the reasoning flows smoothly and does not confuse the evaluator.
