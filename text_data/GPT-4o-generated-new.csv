我已经记不清那时怎样地将我的纯真热烈的爱表示给她。岂但现在，那时的事后便已模胡，夜间回想，早只剩了一些断片了；同居以后一两月，便连这些断片也 化作无可追踪的梦影。我只记得那时以前的十几天，曾经很仔细地研究过表示的态度，排列过措辞的先后，以及倘或遭了拒绝以后的情形。可是临时似乎都无用，在 慌张中，身不由己地竟用了在电影上见过的方法了。后来一想到，就使我很愧恧，但在记忆上却偏只有这一点永远留遗，至今还如暗室的孤灯一般，照见我含泪握着 她的手，一条腿跪了下去……。不但我自己的，便是子君的言语举动，我那时就没有看得分明；仅知道她已经允许我了。但也还仿佛记得她脸色*变成青白，后来又渐渐转作绯红，——没有见 过，也没有再见的绯红；孩子似的眼里射出悲喜，但是夹着惊疑的光，虽然力避我的视线，张皇地似乎要破窗飞去。然而我知道她已经允许我了，没有知道她怎样说 或是没有说。她却是什么都记得：我的言辞，竟至于读熟了的一般，能够滔滔背诵；我的举动，就如有一张我所看不见的影片挂在眼下，叙述得如生，很细微，自然连那使我 不愿再想的浅薄的电影的一闪。夜阑人静，是相对温习的时候了，我常是被质问，被考验，并且被命复述当时的言语，然而常须由她补足，由她纠正，像一个丁等的 学生。这温习后来也渐渐稀疏起来。但我只要看见她两眼注视空中，出神似的凝想着，于是神色*越加柔和，笑窝也深下去，便知道她又在自修旧课了，只是我很怕她看到我那可笑的电影的一闪。但我又知道，她一定要看见，而且也非看不可的。,"晚上，在书房的昏黄灯光下，子君的微笑在我脑海中逐渐清晰。那是五年前的一个夜晚，月色皎洁，我们并肩走在河堤旁的青石板路上。我隐约记得，当时的我心跳如雷，汗水在掌心蒸汽化，热烈地表白了自己的感情。子君则安静地站在我身侧，双手紧握的动作至今犹存，但我无法回忆起更多细节。

不同的是，子君却记得那一切。她总是在某些夜阑人静的时候，翻动我们彼此的旧日回忆。她甚至会细述我当时的言辞和举动，仿佛那些画面刻印在她的心底，永不褪色。她轻声说道：“你对我说，‘子君，从第一眼见到你的那刻起，我的心就被你俘虏了。’”她的眼神中透露出一种柔和的光芒，似乎在享受这些旧日的甜蜜。当她问起我是否还记得这些细节时，我感觉到一阵愧疚和尴尬。

每次子君考验我重述那晚的情景，我发现自己想产生某种记忆，但却总是徒劳无功。她时常会笑着说：“你好糊涂，怎么会忘得这么干净？”我笑而不答，但心中的那份愧疚却在悸动。我小心翼翼地避开她的问题，深怕自己模糊的记忆会伤害到她。

在一个无眠的夜晚，我望着窗外的星空，回想着过去那些逝去的时光。子君的声音在脑海中回荡，她的笑容，她的目光，那些她曾在宁静的夜晚考验我重述的情景。我开始意识到，也许我从未真正用心记住这些细节，而她却珍藏着每一刻的点滴。

我走进子君的房间，轻声道歉：“对不起，子君，我真的很愧疚，没能把那些细节记得那么清楚。”她轻轻一笑，温柔地握住我的手，说：“傻瓜，记得那些细节并不重要，重要的是你现在还在我的身边。”那一刻，我心中变得格外温暖。

从那以后，我开始用心记录我们的每一个瞬间，生怕遗漏掉点滴细节。我想，为了子君，为了我们共同的回忆，我不能再错过任何一丝幸福的感觉。",易,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字描述了作者回忆起与子君表示爱意时的情景。尽管作者对当时的细节记得模糊，但子君却记得很清楚，包括他的言辞和举动。子君会在夜阑人静时相对温习这些旧事，甚至考验作者重述当时的情景，使作者感到愧疚和尴尬。,636

当我沉默着的时候，我觉得充实；我将开口，同时感到空虚。过去的生命已经死亡。我对于这死亡有大欢喜，因为我借此知道它曾经存活。死亡的生命已经朽腐。我对于这朽腐有大欢喜，因为我借此知道它还非空虚。 生命的泥委弃在地面上，不生乔木，只生野草，这是我的罪过。野草，根本不深，花叶不美，然而吸取露，吸取水，吸取陈死人的血和肉，各各夺取它的生存。当生存时，还是将遭践踏，将遭删刈，直至于死亡而朽腐。 但我坦然，欣然。我将大笑，我将歌唱。我自爱我的野草，但我憎恶这以野草作装饰的地面。地火在地下运行，奔突；熔岩一旦喷出，将烧尽一切野草，以及乔木，于是并且无可朽腐。但我坦然，欣然。 我将大笑，我将歌唱。天地有如此静穆，我不能大笑而且歌唱。天地即不如此静穆，我或者也将不能。我以这一丛野草， 在明与暗，生与死，过去与未来之际，献于友与仇，人与兽，爱者与不爱者之前作证。 为我自己，为友与仇，人与兽，爱者与不爱者，我希望这野草的朽腐，火速到来。要不然，我先就未曾生存，这实在比死亡与朽腐更其不幸。 去罢，野草，连着我的题辞！,"在这个喧嚣尘世之中，我常常感到语言的无力与空虚。每当我试图用言语来表达内心的感受和思索，它们仿佛总是力不从心，无法触及灵魂最深处的真实。只有在沉默中，我似乎才能找到那份真实的充实感。沉默让我反思，反思那些已逝的岁月，反思生命的轮回和存在的意义。尽管那些过去的生命已经消逝，但它们的存在曾让我心生温暖与欣慰，因为它们的逝去见证了其真实的存在过。

死亡，总是带来朽腐的气息，那朽腐的味道是如此的刺鼻和真实。然而，正是这种朽腐，也在无言之中诉说着生命的故事——诉说着它的曾经、它的鲜活。每当我闭上双眼，仿佛都能看到那些象征着生命的野草在风中摇曳。无人欣赏，无人驻足，它们仅仅是凭借一腔执着，生存在这无情的天地之间。

我将自己比作那野草，微小、卑微，但却只愿坚韧地生存下去。然而，即便如此顽强，终将逃不过命运的践踏，直到完全消亡。面对这一切，我内心却未曾有过恐惧，反而有一种坦然的情怀。或许是在这无尽的静穆天地之间，我的灵魂早已学会了释怀，学会了在大笑和歌唱中迎接自己的腐朽。我希望自己的朽腐能够作为见证，见证在这明暗交织的世界中，我的生死、过去与未来。也许，早日迎来这腐朽，才是对我存在过最真实的肯定，因为在这世上没有真正活过，比死亡更加不幸。",易,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字表达了一种对生命和死亡的深刻思考。作者在沉默中感到充实，但在言语中感到空虚，反思过去的生命已消逝，并因其曾存在而感到欣慰。死亡带来朽腐，朽腐意味着生命曾真实存在过。作者将自身比作野草，虽然无人欣赏，却执着生存，但终将被命运践踏直到消亡。尽管如此，作者坦然面对，愿在静穆天地间大笑歌唱，希望以野草的朽腐作证，证明在明暗、生死、过去与未来之间的存在，并希望这腐朽早日到来，因为没有真正活过比死亡更为不幸。,456

"我家的后面有一个很大的园，相传叫作“百草园”。现在是早已并屋子一起卖给朱文公的子孙了，连那最末次的相见也已经隔了七八年，其中似乎确凿只有一些野草；但那时却是我的乐园。

不必说碧绿的菜畦，光滑的石井栏，高大的皂荚树，紫红的桑椹；也不必说鸣蝉在树叶里长吟，肥胖的黄蜂伏在菜花上，轻捷的叫天子(云雀)忽然从草间直窜向云霄里去了。单是周围的短短的泥墙根一带，就有无限趣味。油蛉在这里低唱，蟋蟀们在这里弹琴。翻开断砖来，有时会遇见蜈蚣；还有斑蝥，倘若用手指按住它的脊梁，便会拍的一声，从后窍喷出一阵烟雾。何首乌藤和木莲藤缠络着，木莲有莲房一般的果实，何首乌有臃肿的根。有人说，何首乌根是有像人形的，吃了便可以成仙，我于是常常拔它起来，牵连不断地拔起来，也曾因此弄坏了泥墙，却从来没有见过有一块根像人样。如果不怕刺，还可以摘到覆盆子，像小珊瑚珠攒成的小球，又酸又甜，色味都比桑椹要好得远。

长的草里是不去的，因为相传这园里有一条很大的赤练蛇。

长妈妈曾经讲给我一个故事听：先前，有一个读书人住在古庙里用功，晚间，在院子里纳凉的时候，突然听到有人在叫他。答应着，四面看时，却见一个美女的脸露在墙头上，向他一笑，隐去了。他很高兴，但竟给那走来夜谈的老和尚识破了机关。说他脸上有些妖气，一定遇见“美女蛇”了；这是人首蛇身的怪物，能唤人名，倘一答应，夜间便要来吃这人的肉的。他自然吓得要死，而那老和尚却道无妨，给他一个小盒子，说只要放在枕边，便可高枕而卧。他虽然照样办，却总是睡不着，──当然睡不着的。到半夜，果然来了，沙沙沙！门外像是风雨声。他正抖作一团时，却听得“豁”的一声，一道金光从枕边飞出，外面便什么声音也没有了，那金光也就飞回来，敛在盒子里。后来呢？后来，老和尚说，这是飞蜈蚣，它能吸蛇的脑髓，美女蛇就被它治死了。

结末的教训是：所以倘有陌生的声音叫你的名字，你万不可答应他。

这故事很使我觉得做人之险，夏夜乘凉，往往有些担心，不敢去看墙上，而且极想得到一盒老和尚那样的飞蜈蚣。走到百草园的草丛旁边时，也常常这样想。但直到现在，总还是没有得到，但也没有遇见过赤练蛇和美女蛇。叫我名字的陌生声音自然是常有的，然而都不是美女蛇。","童年的百草园是一片自由的天空，那是一个充满奇趣与欢笑的地方。百草园位于我们家的后院，是一个不大的园子，但在我的记忆中，它的每一处角落都充满了奇妙的景象与美丽的故事。园中的植物构成了一个色彩缤纷的世界：盛夏时节，野花满园，各种各样叫不上名字的小花，五颜六色地绽放着，蜜蜂和蝴蝶在花丛中忙碌地飞舞着，发出轻柔的嗡嗡声。在园子的东南角，有一棵高大的槐树，枝叶繁茂，每到春天，槐花便如雪般洒满地面。靠着槐树树干的一角，还有一些矮矮的植物，种类多样，草木葱茏，铺就一片绿毯，这里是我和小伙伴们玩耍的乐园。

在百草园里，不仅有丰富多样的植物，还有各种奇异的小动物。泥墙根下，是我们发现宝藏的地方。那儿隐藏着一个个的小洞穴，一到春夏季节，小洞里就会爬出来各种小虫子。知了用歌声扰乱着寂静的空气，蜥蜴们在墙根四处游走，把脑袋探出来瞅瞅这个奇妙的世界。有时，运气好的时候，还能看到泥鳅蠕动着在泥土里穿行，一副忙碌的样子。小时候的我，常常和伙伴们用小木棍去捅这些小洞，看看里面会不会跑出什么有趣的小东西。

在百草园的某个角落，有一个长满苔藓的地方，小时候我们称这里为“密林”。密林中常常有一些我们不易察觉的小动物出没。记得有一次，我发现了一对儿正交颈嬉戏的小鸟，它们轻快地跳跃在枝头，唧唧喳喳地呼唤着彼此，这紧紧吸引了我的目光。我的长妈妈是一个讲故事的好手，在我和朋友们玩累了的时候，她常常会坐在园中的木椅上，给我们讲故事。她有一次讲的是关于一个美女蛇的故事。长妈妈说，那是一个暮色四合的傍晚，在园子深处，有一条绝美的美女蛇，它的人身蛇尾令无数人为之惊叹，但同时也让人心生畏惧。这个故事令我和小伙伴们在夜晚思绪万千，脸上布满了好奇和惊讶的神情。

夏夜来临时，百草园也散发着独特的魅力。每当夜幕降临，园中的蜡烛点亮后，四周便洋溢着一片安宁祥和的气息。星星在夜空中闪烁，我们围坐在院子里，聆听夜风吹过树叶的沙沙声。可有时，风声和虫鸣外，会有一种陌生的声音在耳边回荡，那是几不可闻，却令我感到无端惶恐的声响。长妈妈告诉我，那是夏虫的低语，是自然的呢喃，不必害怕。然而我仍然会躲在她的身旁，心中充满了想要驱走这种不安的欲望。

说到夏夜，我极为期待园子里出现一种神奇的小生物——飞蜈蚣。据说它的身影穿梭于夜晚的园子间，火红的身躯在暗夜中发出微光，犹如飞舞的火星。多少次，我在夏夜的园中徘徊，眼睛紧紧盯着每一个角落，希望能够发现这神秘的小生物。飞蜈蚣成了我童年记忆中一个奇特的愿望，它象征着纯真年代里那份毫无保留的探索欲与对未知世界的憧憬。",易,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字描述了作者童年时的乐园——百草园的美好景象，详细描绘了园中的植物和动物，以及园中泥墙根一带的趣味。此外，作者还叙述了长妈妈讲述的一个关于美女蛇的故事，并表达了自己夏夜乘凉时因听到陌生声音而产生的担忧和想要得到飞蜈蚣的心情。,923

"然而阿Q虽然常优胜，却直待蒙赵太爷打他嘴巴之后，这才出了名。
他付过地保二百文酒钱，愤愤的躺下了，后来想：“现在的世界太不成话，儿子打老子……”于是忽而想到赵太爷的威风，而现在是他的儿子了，便自己也渐渐的得意起来，爬起身，唱着《小孤孀上坟》到酒店去。这时侯，他又觉得赵太爷高人一等了。
说也奇怪，从此之后，果然大家也仿佛格外尊敬他。这在阿Q，或者以为因为他是赵太爷的父亲，而其实也不然。未庄通例，倘如阿七打阿八，或者李四打张三，向来本不算一件事，必须与一位名人如赵太爷者相关，这才载上他们的口碑。一上口碑，则打的既有名，被打的也就托庇有了名。至于错在阿Q，那自然是不必说。所以者何?就因为赵太爷是不会错的。但他既然错，为什么大家又仿佛格外尊敬他呢?这可难解，穿凿起来说，或者因为阿Q说是赵太爷的本家，虽然挨了打，大家也还怕有些真，总不如尊敬一些稳当。否则，也如孔庙里的太牢一般，虽然与猪羊一样，同是畜生，但既经圣人下箸，先儒们便不敢妄动了。","自从阿Q被赵太爷打了一顿嘴巴，未庄这个小小村庄里，连日里的喇叭响起来都多了几分热闹。人们纷纷议论，细细品评这件事的内涵和外延。阿Q原本只是一个无甚地位、嫖赌皆沾、不务正业的小人物，然而这场风波之后，未庄的人对他的态度却骤然改变了。

那日，阿Q正窝在村头的破草堆里打盹，几粒陈芝麻的旧酱香混着清晨的露水黏在他的下巴上。他眼神迷离，半梦半醒间，早有几个村里比他高一辈的老人家在一旁嘀嘀咕咕地说：“啧，人还真是不得了啊，能让赵太爷亲自教训一通，这回阿Q怕是要上位喽。”

阿Q听着心下得意，仿佛真的被赵太爷认可了似的。他抬起头，望了望村里的那座气派的赵府，只觉得自己与赵太爷仿佛有了一层独特的联系。阿Q笑得眯起了眼，嘴角上扬的弧度带着一种胁人的骄傲：“你们看，我阿Q也是能入赵太爷眼里的人。”

确实，未庄的居民渐渐对阿Q有了几分敬畏之心。明面上，他们会对阿Q客气起来，有时路过还会稍微侧身避让。这让阿Q愈发感到自己“上了道”。他时常在村外的老树下坐一整天，抽着从村长家顺来的旱烟，假装自己是个老成持重的人，丰富的烟雾仿佛是他身份的象征。

然而，未庄的人们心知肚明，这份“尊敬”并非出于真心。他们私底下还是对阿Q嗤之以鼻，但因赵太爷的威望和不容冒犯的态度，他们不敢轻易得罪阿Q，怕他真有日子向赵太爷告状，或者将他与赵府的关系私下告知赚点蝇头小利。

村里的老刘头曾对他的小孙子絮絮叨叨：“就像孔庙里的太牢，虽然本质上还是那头兽类，但圣人动了筷子，这谁还敢乱动呢？阿Q就是这么个理儿，咱们宁可敬着他些，也不敢招惹。”小孙子听着似懂非懂，只知道老刘头说道有道理。

时间久了，阿Q开始真的相信，自己与赵太爷有着不可动摇的“亲缘”。他走路时昂着头，甚至幻想赵太爷有一天会主动来找他谈话。到了夜里，他也许会梦见赵太爷把他带进赵府，赐他一碗热腾腾的饭菜，甚至点拨他几句做人的妙法。醒来后，阿Q便愈加自信，全然沉浸在幻象的自我满足中。

未庄的人们渐渐习惯了阿Q的新面貌，习惯了他的假笑和仿佛了不起的气场。然而他们也清楚，这只不过是为了保持表面的平静。赵太爷是否真正认可阿Q，无人得知，但村民选择了哄着他，毕竟有赵太爷在背后罩着，哪怕只是一种空洞的影子。

某个秋日的午后，天高云淡，阿Q悠闲地靠在村口，轻轻拨弄着一根枯草。远远地，几个孩童肆无忌惮地追逐打闹，一个调皮的孩子朝着阿Q的方向吐了吐舌头，作了个鬼脸。随即，另一个孩子急急拉住了他，小声警告道：“别这样，他可是赵太爷的……咱们惹不起。”

阿Q听见了，心里像吃了蜜一样甜，他望着那群孩子远去的方向，嘴角的笑意扩大了几分。在他的认知中，未庄已经算是他的半个天下了。赵太爷打他的那一顿，仿佛是赐予他的某种至高无上的荣耀，也许无人能懂，但在阿Q的内心深处，那是他无可怀疑的骄傲来源。

夜深人静，人们早早就寝，未庄回归了宁静。阿Q蹲坐在屋外，凝视星空，嘴中叼着没点燃的旱烟。蝉声断续在耳边，空气里还悬着白天的余温。他在心里默念着：“赵太爷，你早晚会认出我的，我阿Q，可不是一般人。”

这样自信又矛盾的心态，成为阿Q与未庄居民共存的一部分。赵太爷的名字在他口中，仿佛一张通行证，让他在未庄中披了一层看似坚不可摧的外壳。也许谁也不会想到，这层虚幻的光环背后所隐藏的是一个小人物内心最真实的渴望与幻想，而这个渺小的世界里，他是他自己最虔诚的信徒。",易,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,阿Q因为被赵太爷打了一顿嘴巴而“出了名”，他认为自己因此成为赵太爷的父亲，并感到得意。未庄的居民因此更加尊敬他，虽然这其实是因为赵太爷的威望和不得罪的态度所致。居民尊敬阿Q的原因是担心他与赵太爷有关系，这种现象类似于孔庙里的太牢，虽然本质是兽类，但因为经圣人动筷子，所以不能妄动。,1530
"然而阿Q虽然常优胜，却直待蒙赵太爷打他嘴巴之后，这才出了名。
他付过地保二百文酒钱，愤愤的躺下了，后来想：“现在的世界太不成话，儿子打老子……”于是忽而想到赵太爷的威风，而现在是他的儿子了，便自己也渐渐的得意起来，爬起身，唱着《小孤孀上坟》到酒店去。这时侯，他又觉得赵太爷高人一等了。
说也奇怪，从此之后，果然大家也仿佛格外尊敬他。这在阿Q，或者以为因为他是赵太爷的父亲，而其实也不然。未庄通例，倘如阿七打阿八，或者李四打张三，向来本不算一件事，必须与一位名人如赵太爷者相关，这才载上他们的口碑。一上口碑，则打的既有名，被打的也就托庇有了名。至于错在阿Q，那自然是不必说。所以者何?就因为赵太爷是不会错的。但他既然错，为什么大家又仿佛格外尊敬他呢?这可难解，穿凿起来说，或者因为阿Q说是赵太爷的本家，虽然挨了打，大家也还怕有些真，总不如尊敬一些稳当。否则，也如孔庙里的太牢一般，虽然与猪羊一样，同是畜生，但既经圣人下箸，先儒们便不敢妄动了。",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,阿Q因为被赵太爷打了一顿嘴巴而“出了名”，他认为自己因此成为赵太爷的父亲，并感到得意。未庄的居民因此更加尊敬他，虽然这其实是因为赵太爷的威望和不得罪的态度所致。居民尊敬阿Q的原因是担心他与赵太爷有关系，这种现象类似于孔庙里的太牢，虽然本质是兽类，但因为经圣人动筷子，所以不能妄动。,1530

"那天下午，曼璐的母亲打电话来，把从前那小大姐阿宝的地址告诉她。曼璐从前没有用阿宝，原是因为鸿才常喜欢跟她搭讪，曼璐觉得有点危险性。现在情形不同了，她倒又觉得身边有阿宝这样一个人也好，或者可以拉得住鸿才。她没想到鸿才今非昔比，这样一个小大姐，他哪里放在眼里。
当下她把阿宝的地址记了下来，她母亲道：“昨天你二妹回来，说你好了些了。”曼璐道：“是好多了。等我好了我来看妈。”她本来说要请她母亲来住两天，现在也不提了，也是因为她妹妹的关系，她想还是疏远一点的好。虽然这桩事完全不怪她妹妹，更不与她母亲相干，她在电话上说话的口吻却有点冷淡，也许是不自觉的。顾太太虽然不是一个爱多心的人，但是女儿现在太阔了，贫富悬殊，有些地方就不能不多着点心。当下便道：“好，你一好了就来玩，奶奶也惦记着你呢。”
自从这一次通过电话，顾太太一连好两个月也没去探望女儿。曼璐也一直没有和他们通音信。这一天她到市区里来买东西，顺便弯到娘家来看看。她好久没回来过了，坐着一辆特大特长的最新型汽车，看衖堂的和一些邻人都站在那里看着，也可以算是衣锦荣归了。她的弟弟们在衖堂里学骑脚踏车，一个青年替他们扶着车子，曼桢也站在后门口，抱着胳膊倚在门上看着。曼璐跳下汽车，曼桢笑道：“咦，姊姊来了！”
那青年听见这称呼，似乎非常注意，掉转目光向曼璐这边看来，然而曼璐的眼睛像闪电似的，也正在那里打量着他，他的眼神没有她那样足，敌不过她，急忙望到别处去了。他所得到的印象只是一个穿着皮大衣的中年太太。原来曼璐现在力争上游，为了配合她的身份地位，已经放弃了她的舞台化妆，假睫毛，眼黑，大红的胭脂，一概不用了。她不知道她这样正是自动地缴了械。时间是残酷的，在她这个年龄，浓妆艳抹固然更显憔悴，但是，突然打扮成一个中年妇人的模样，也只有更像一个中年妇人。
曼璐本来还不觉得，今天到绸缎店去买衣料，她把一块紫红色的拿起来看看，正考虑间，那不识相的伙计却极力推荐一块深蓝色的，说：“是您自己穿吗？这蓝的好，大方。”曼璐心里很生气，想道：“你当我是个老太太吗？我倒偏要买那块红的！”虽然赌气买了下来，心里却很不高兴。
今天她母亲也不高兴，因为她的小弟弟杰民把腿摔伤了。曼璐上楼去，她母亲正在那里替杰民包扎膝部。曼璐道：“嗳呀，怎么摔得这样厉害？”顾太太道：“怪他自己呀！一定要学着骑车，我就知道要闯祸！有了这部车子，就都发了疯似的，你也骑我也骑！”曼璐道：“这自行车是新买的么？”顾太太道：“是你大弟弟说，他那学堂太远了，每天乘电车去，还是骑车合算。一直就想要一部自行车，我可是没给他买。新近沈先生买了一部送给他。”说到这里，她把眉毛紧紧蹙了起来。世钧送他们一辆脚踏车，她当时是很高兴的，可是现在因为心疼孩子，不免就迁怒到世钧身上去了。",曼璐站在窗前，望着镜子里的自己，心情复杂难以言喻。耳边还回响着母亲的声音，她决定听从母亲的建议，重新联系阿宝。时间改变了一切，她与阿宝也早已不是从前那般亲密无间了。过去的回忆像一幕幕快闪在脑海中，她轻叹一声，这一切都仿佛在昨日，又仿佛隔了千年。电话那头，母亲的声音带着些许倦意，‘联系阿宝吧，她一直都是个靠谱的人。’母亲的话简单明了，但曼璐却听出了她心中的不宁。这些年来，母亲比她更敏锐地感知到她的变化，尽管她的口气有些冷淡，但母亲依旧极力地关心着她。挂断电话后，曼璐决定去市区买些日常用品。她踏上公共汽车，看着车窗外飞快倒退的风景，心中五味杂陈。多年来她一直忙于家庭事务，渐渐疏远了娘家人，心中自有几分酸楚。曼璐决定要在购买所需物品后顺便回娘家探望一下。汽车在市中心停下，她下车后步行穿过几条街道，买了几件生活必需品，然后迈着稍显疲惫的步伐，朝着熟悉的路径走去。终于，站在那扇熟悉的门前，她深吸一口气，推开了门。‘妈妈，我回来了。’她试探性地喊了一声。母亲从厨房探出头来，看到女儿，有些意外但更多的还是高兴，‘你怎么来了？’母亲走过来，眼神柔和。‘正好出门买东西，顺便过来看看。’曼璐勉强挤出一个微笑，她环顾四周，家里的摆设依旧，可她的心情却因时间和身份的变化而有所不同。时间仿佛在她回家的一瞬间静止，久违的家的味道让她感到既熟悉又陌生。厨房里飘来的饭菜香气，将她拉回到那些年她和弟弟们在这儿度过的无数个日日夜夜。她走到客厅，看到几个弟弟正在兴高采烈地学骑自行车。小弟弟杰民格外引人注目，他摔了一跤，脸上的青痕依旧可见。‘你怎么弄成这样？’曼璐皱起眉头，看着杰民。‘没事姐，我摔了一下，沈先生前几天送来的自行车真的很好！’杰民笑得无所谓，但母亲的神情却不那么轻松。‘你说什么呢？车送来没几天就让你摔成这样，还夸他！’母亲插话进来，明显对这个情况很不高兴，她的语气透出几分责怪。‘妈，这也不能全怪沈先生吧，是我自己不小心。’杰民无辜地看着母亲，试图为沈先生辩解。‘他明知道你们还不熟练，干嘛送个这么大这么快的车，真是的！’母亲的迁怒显而易见。曼璐站在一边，看着这一切，心里五味杂陈。或许这就是家庭的力量，无论是甜蜜还是冲突，都在这小小的空间中显得那么真实。那么近，又那么远。‘妈，别太生气，小孩子总会有摔跤的时候。’她轻声安慰母亲，心里却明白，真正让人心痛的是那些时间带来的不可逆转的变化。,易,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字讲述了曼璐在母亲的建议下联系了从前的小大姐阿宝，并因为丈夫的原因决定重新用阿宝。曼璐与母亲通话时口气有些冷淡，她母亲虽然感到女儿的变化，但依然关心她。之后，曼璐去市区买东西，顺便回娘家探望，感受到时间和身份的变化带给自己的冲击。在娘家，曼璐看到弟弟们在学骑自行车，知道小弟弟杰民因为骑车摔伤，母亲对这个情况很不高兴，并迁怒于送车的沈先生。,1154

"虞姬的心在绞痛，当她看见项王倔强的嘴唇转成了白色，他的眼珠发出冷冷的玻璃一样的光辉，那双眼睛向前瞪着的神气是那样的可怕，使她忍不住用她宽大的袖子去掩住它。她能够觉得他的睫毛在她的掌心急促地翼翼扇动，她又觉得一串冰凉的泪珠从她手里一直滚到她的臂弯里，这是她第一次知道那英雄的叛徒也是会流泪的动物。
“可怜的……可怜的……”底下的话听不出了，她的苍白的嘴唇轻轻翕动着。他甩掉她的手，拖着沉重的脚步，歪歪斜斜走回帐篷里。她跟了进来，看见他伛偻着腰坐在榻上，双手捧着头。蜡烛只点剩了拇指长的一截。残晓的清光已经透进了帷幔。“给我点酒。”他抬起眼来说。当他提着满泛了琥珀的流光的酒盏在手里的时候，他把手撑在膝盖上，微笑地看着她。
“虞姬，我们完了。我早就有些怀疑，为什么江东没有运粮到垓下来。过去的事多说也无益。我们现在只有一件事可做——冲出去。看这情形，我们是注定了要做被包围的困兽了，可是我们不要做被猎的，我们要做猎人。明天——啊，不，今天——今天是我最后一次的行猎了。我要冲出一条血路，从汉军的军盔上面踏过去！哼，那刘邦，他以为我已经被他关进笼子里了吗？我至少还有一次畅快的围猎的机会，也许我的猎枪会刺穿他的心，像我刺穿一只贵重的紫貂一样。虞姬，披上你的波斯软甲，你得跟随我，直到最后一分钟。我们都要死在马背上。”“大王，我想你是懂得我的，”虞姬低着头，用手理着项王枕边的小刀的流苏。“这是你最后一次上战场，我愿意您充分地发挥你的神威，充分地享受屠杀的快乐。我不会跟在您的背后，让您分心，顾虑我，保护我，使得江东的子弟兵讪笑您为了一个女人失去了战斗的能力。”
“噢，那你就留在后方，让汉军的士兵发现你，去把你献给刘邦吧！”虞姬微笑。她很迅速地把小刀抽出了鞘，只一刺，就深深地刺进了她的胸膛。项羽冲过去托住她的腰，她的手还紧紧抓着那镶金的刀柄，项羽俯下他的含泪的火一般光明的大眼睛紧紧瞅着她。她张开她的眼，然后，仿佛受不住这样强烈的阳光似的，她又合上了它们。项羽把耳朵凑到她的颤动的唇边，他听见她在说一句他所不懂的话：“我比较喜欢那样的收梢。”
等她的身体渐渐冷了之后，项王把她胸脯上的刀拔了出来，在他的军衣上揩抹掉血渍。然后，咬着牙，用一种沙嗄的野猪的吼声似的声音，他喊叫：“军曹，吹起画角！吩咐备马，我们要冲下山去！”",残破的营地中，星光隐约可见，然而斗转星移，天地之间传来阵阵急促的战鼓声，掺杂着阵阵呜咽，让整个垓下更加显得寒冷肃杀。虞姬轻轻走到帐外，被黑暗笼罩，唯有身旁的帐篷斑斑驳驳地映着营火的光辉。她望向那辉煌一世的英雄——项羽，此时正目视远方，眉间紧锁。虞姬的心中涌起一阵痛楚，虽是深爱着的她的项王，但此刻他的目光却似乎那么遥远、无助，竟有泪光莹然闪动，那泪珠未悬挂久久，化作一声重重的叹息，融进了这浓重的夜色中。       眼前的纷乱与喧嚣并未消散，仿佛千军万马的喧嚣声散布在项羽内心的各个角落，难以平息。战鼓依旧急促，敌军的包围圈逐步缩小，内忧外患，项羽心中燃烧着不可名状的孤寂与绝望。他回头望见虞姬，那戚戚的神情更添硼荏。虞姬透过泪眼望向项羽，心底想着，不论这次突围是否成功，她一定要留下来，她要成为项王顽强的斗志，她不能成为他的负担。虞姬知道，此刻的项羽是在等待着一个无法避免的结局，但她也愿意给予他最后一些慰藉。      项羽站在帐前，沉着脸色对手下将领们吩咐：“明日，我们将作最后一次突围，全力应战。”声音低沉浑厚，听在虞姬耳中，却像是一种决然的送别。虞姬微微抬起头，望着深邃的夜空，那繁星闪烁，她笑了，笑得如初会时的甜美，却又满含心酸。       项羽的目光与虞姬相对，那双眼里的坚韧，是支撑他坚持下来的唯一信念。虞姬轻轻地抚摸着怀中的剑，这是陪伴她多年的信物，今晚，她将用它来告别这世间的一切，为了她的项王，不成为他的累赘。       翌日清晨，雾霭未散，空气中弥漫着阵阵血腥的味道。虞姬一身白衣，面容清丽却略显苍白，站在项羽身旁，迟迟没有辨别项羽的方向。她微笑着对项羽说：“项王，虞姬再也不会成为你的负担，我会在这里永远陪伴你。”语音开始颤抖，却掩饰不住决心，虞姬坚定地拿出那把细剑，霎时间只见那一抹鲜艳的红喷涌而出，如绽放在寒冷冬日里的梅花，无比凄丽。 鲜血染红了虞姬的衣襟，她在项羽怀里轻轻倒下，脸上依旧挂着那抹安心的笑容，那笑容仿佛燃烧了她全部的生命。       项羽抱着虞姬的身体，心中如刀绞一般疼痛，泪流满面。不知过了多久，他将虞姬的身体轻轻放在地上，他擦干眼泪，仰天长笑了一声，声音在整个营地中回荡，“虞姬，我项王不负此生，请你在九泉之下安心，我定然带领士兵突围出去。”      项羽拿起长剑，望向远方，那是一条没有归路的道路，但他却将虞姬的决绝化为了无穷无尽的动力，宛若存在于天地间那不屈的灵魂。项羽带领他的士兵，成千上万的敌人蜂拥而至，却意外地难以近身，不断冲杀，他如一头怒狮，震慑四方，愤怒、决绝，甚至那一刻，他似乎化身那苍天之英雄。  逐渐地，负重已置之度外，他与士兵们冲出重围，惨烈的喜悦充满了心怀，但那儿只是开始，项羽知道，后续还有更多的彷徨与未知在等待着他，而他所能走的路，只剩下无尽的沙场。    虞姬的离去，成为了项羽最后的温柔，垓下夜色未央，英雄却已踏上了无归之道，虞姬的笑脸与那一抹鲜红，永远铭刻在他心中，成为他永不停息的驱动力，与他并肩共赴那永恒的战场。,易,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字描写了项羽与虞姬在垓下被围困的情景。虞姬目睹项羽的痛苦，意识到即使是英雄也会流泪。在绝境中，项羽决定做最后一次突围，希望能够享受战斗的最后快乐。虞姬不愿成为项羽的负担，最终选择自刎。项羽在虞姬死后，决定带领士兵冲出包围。这段文字表现了虞姬的坚定与项羽的决绝。,970

“可怜的……可怜的……”底下的话听不出了，她的苍白的嘴唇轻轻翕动着。他甩掉她的手，拖着沉重的脚步，歪歪斜斜走回帐篷里。她跟了进来，看见他伛偻着腰坐在榻上，双手捧着头。蜡烛只点剩了拇指长的一截。残晓的清光已经透进了帷幔。“给我点酒。”他抬起眼来说。当他提着满泛了琥珀的流光的酒盏在手里的时候，他把手撑在膝盖上，微笑地看着她。
“虞姬，我们完了。我早就有些怀疑，为什么江东没有运粮到垓下来。过去的事多说也无益。我们现在只有一件事可做——冲出去。看这情形，我们是注定了要做被包围的困兽了，可是我们不要做被猎的，我们要做猎人。明天——啊，不，今天——今天是我最后一次的行猎了。我要冲出一条血路，从汉军的军盔上面踏过去！哼，那刘邦，他以为我已经被他关进笼子里了吗？我至少还有一次畅快的围猎的机会，也许我的猎枪会刺穿他的心，像我刺穿一只贵重的紫貂一样。虞姬，披上你的波斯软甲，你得跟随我，直到最后一分钟。我们都要死在马背上。”“大王，我想你是懂得我的，”虞姬低着头，用手理着项王枕边的小刀的流苏。“这是你最后一次上战场，我愿意您充分地发挥你的神威，充分地享受屠杀的快乐。我不会跟在您的背后，让您分心，顾虑我，保护我，使得江东的子弟兵讪笑您为了一个女人失去了战斗的能力。”
“噢，那你就留在后方，让汉军的士兵发现你，去把你献给刘邦吧！”虞姬微笑。她很迅速地把小刀抽出了鞘，只一刺，就深深地刺进了她的胸膛。项羽冲过去托住她的腰，她的手还紧紧抓着那镶金的刀柄，项羽俯下他的含泪的火一般光明的大眼睛紧紧瞅着她。她张开她的眼，然后，仿佛受不住这样强烈的阳光似的，她又合上了它们。项羽把耳朵凑到她的颤动的唇边，他听见她在说一句他所不懂的话：“我比较喜欢那样的收梢。”

"这次，我看到了草原。那里的天比别处的更可爱，空气是那么清鲜，天空是那么明朗，使我总想高歌一曲，表示我满心的愉快。在天底下，一碧千里，而并不茫茫。四面都有小丘，平地是绿的，小丘也是绿的。羊群一会儿上了小丘，一会儿又下来，走在哪里都像给无边的绿毯绣上了白色的大花。
那些小丘的线条是那么柔美，就像只用绿色渲染，不用墨线勾勒的中国画那样，到处翠色欲流，轻轻流入云际。这种境界，既使人惊叹，又叫人舒服，既愿久立四望，又想坐下低吟一首奇丽的小诗。在这境界里，连骏马和大牛都有时候静立不动，好像回味着草原的无限乐趣。
我们访问的是陈巴尔虎旗。汽车走了一百五十里，才到达目的地。一百五十里全是草原。再走一百五十里，也还是草原。草原上行车十分洒脱，只要方向不错，怎么走都可以。初入草原，听不见一点儿声音，也看不见什么东西，除了一些忽飞忽落的小鸟。
走了许久，远远地望见了一条迂回的明如玻璃的带子——河！牛羊多起来，也看到了马群，隐隐有鞭子的轻响。快了，快到了。忽然，像被一阵风吹来似的，远处的小丘上出现了一群马，马上的男女老少穿着各色的衣裳，群马疾驰，襟飘带舞，像一条彩虹向我们飞过来。
这是主人来到几十里外欢迎远客。见到我们，主人们立刻拨转马头，欢呼着，飞驰着，在汽车左右与前面引路。静寂的草原热闹起来：欢呼声，车声，马蹄声，响成一片。车跟着马飞过小丘，看见了几座蒙古包。","清晨，阳光透过薄雾洒在草原上，天空湛蓝如洗，空气中弥漫着一股清新而令人陶醉的气息。我站在辽阔的陈巴尔虎旗草原上，四周皆是一碧千里的绿草，像一张无边无际的绿色地毯，延伸至天际。整个草原仿佛被一种宁静而安详的美所笼罩，仿若置身于一幅栩栩如生的中国水墨画中，线条柔美的小丘在晨光中若隐若现，又如青烟淡淡飘散而开，给人以无尽的遐想和宁静的愉悦。

汽车在宽广的草原上行驶了整整一百五十里，四周的景象不断变幻却始终离不开那一片绿色。途中，几条清澈见底的小河蜿蜒曲折，犹如银色的丝带流淌在草地上。偶尔，有成群的牛羊悠闲地在草地上吃草，白色的羊群仿佛大自然赠送给这片土地最美的点缀，远远看去，像是无数的小白花撒落在绿毯上，给这片大地增添了无限生机。

经过漫长的车程，目的地终于出现在视线中。前来迎接我们的是一群骑着马的蒙古族主人，他们身穿传统的蒙古袍，脸上挂着热情洋溢的笑容，彷佛要用最真诚的方式迎接远道而来的客人。马蹄声踏破了草原的宁静，平静的草原瞬间变得热闹非凡。随之眼前出现的是一群蒙古包，洁白的毡房在阳光照耀下闪烁着一层温暖的光辉，如同草原上的珍珠，点缀在这片广袤无垠的绿野上。

站在蒙古包前，我深吸一口气，感受着草原独有的气息，一种从未有过的宁静与满足感油然而生。这里没有城市的喧嚣与纷扰，有的只是大自然最原始的美与和谐。我想，这正是草原所给予人们的最珍贵的礼物，不仅仅是眼前的美景，更是一种回归自然、回归心灵的静谧与祥和。",易,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,本文描述了作者在草原上的经历和所见所感。草原的天空明朗，空气清新，一碧千里，绿草如茵，羊群如白色的花点缀其间。小丘线条柔美似中国画，景色令人惊叹和愉悦。访问的地点是陈巴尔虎旗，汽车行驶了一百五十里，全是草原。途中见到河流、牛羊和马群。最终，主人们骑马迎接远客，草原变得热闹起来，最终看到了蒙古包。,583

"母亲的娘家是在北平德胜门外，土城儿外边，通大钟寺的大路上的一个小村里。村里一共有四五家人家，都姓马。大家都种点不十分肥美的土地，但是与我同辈的兄弟们，也有当兵的，作木匠的，作泥水匠的，和当巡察的。他们虽然是农家，却养不起牛马，人手不够的时候，妇女便也须下地作活。

对于姥姥家，我只知道上述的一点。外公外婆是什么样子，我就不知道了，因为他们早已去世。至于更远的族系与家史，就更不晓得了；穷人只能顾眼前的衣食，没有功夫谈论什么过去的光荣：“家谱”这字眼，我在幼年就根本没有听说过。

母亲生在农家，所以勤俭诚实，身体也好。这一点事实却极重要，因为假若我没有这样的一位母亲，我之为我恐怕也就要大大的打个折扣了。

母亲出嫁大概是很早，因为我的大姐现在已是六十多岁的老太婆，而我的大甥女还长我一岁啊。我有三个哥哥，四个姐姐，但能长大成人的，只有大姐，二姐，三哥与我。我是“老”儿子。生我的时候，母亲已四十一岁，大姐二姐已都出了阁。

由大姐与二姐所嫁入的家庭来推断，在我生下之前，我的家里，大概还马马虎虎的过得去。那时候定婚讲究门当户对，而大姐丈是作小官的，二姐丈也开过一间酒馆，他们都是相当体面的人。

可是，我，我给家庭带来了不幸：我生下来，母亲晕过去半夜，才睁眼看见她的老儿子——感谢大姐，把我揣在怀里，致未冻死。

一岁半，我把父亲“克”死了。兄不到十岁，三姐十二三岁，我才一岁半，全仗母亲独力抚养了。父亲的寡姐跟我们一块儿住，她吸鸦片，她喜摸纸牌，她的脾气极坏。为我们的衣食，母亲要给人家洗衣服，缝补或裁缝衣裳。在我的记忆中，她的手终年是鲜红微肿的。白天，她洗衣服，洗一两大绿瓦盆。她作事永远丝毫也不敷衍，就是屠户们送来的黑如铁的布袜，她也给洗得雪白。晚间，她与三姐抱着一盏油灯，还要缝补衣服，一直到半夜。她终年没有休息，可是在忙碌中她还把院子屋中收拾得清清爽爽。桌椅都是旧的，柜门的铜活久已残缺不全，可是她的手老使破桌面上没有尘土，残破的铜活发着光。院中，父亲遗留下的几盆石榴与夹竹桃，永远会得到应有的浇灌与爱护，年年夏天开许多花。

哥哥似乎没有同我玩耍过。有时候，他去读书；有时候，他去学徒；有时候，他也去卖花生或樱桃之类的小东西。母亲含着泪把他送走，不到两天，又含着泪接他回来。我不明白这都是什么事，而只觉得与他很生疏。与母亲相依如命的是我与三姐。因此，她们作事，我老在后面跟着。她们浇花，我也张罗着取水；她们扫地，我就撮土……从这里，我学得了爱花，爱清洁，守秩序。这些习惯至今还被我保存着。

有客人来，无论手中怎么窘，母亲也要设法弄一点东西去款待。舅父与表哥们往往是自己掏钱买酒肉食，这使她脸上羞得飞红，可是，殷勤的给他们温酒作面，又给她一些喜悦。遇上亲友家中有喜丧事，母亲必把大褂洗得干干净净，亲自去贺吊——份礼也许只是两吊小钱。到如今为我的好客的习性，还未全改，尽管生活是这么清苦，因为自幼儿看惯了的事情是不易改掉的。

姑母时常闹脾气。她单在鸡蛋里找骨头。她是我家中的阎王。直到我入中学，她才死去，我可是没有看见母亲反抗过。“没受过婆婆的气，还不受大姑子的吗？命当如此！”母亲在非解释一下不足以平服别人的时候，才这样说。是的，命当如此。母亲活到老，穷到老，辛苦到老，全是命当如此。她最会吃亏。给亲友邻居帮忙，她总跑在前面：她会给婴儿洗三——穷朋友们可以因此少花一笔“请姥姥”钱——她会刮痧，她会给孩子们剃头，她会给少妇们绞脸……凡是她能做的，都有求必应。但是，吵嘴打架，永远没有她。她宁吃亏，不逗气。当姑母死去的时候，母亲似乎把一世的委屈都哭了出来，一直哭到坟地。不知道哪里来的一位侄子，声称有承继权，母亲便一声不响，教他搬走那些破桌烂板凳，而且把姑母养的一只肥肉鸡也送给他。",北平北郊的一个小村庄，晨雾总是早早地消散，静寂的大地在阳光下缓缓苏醒。母亲总是第一个起床的人，伴随着雄鸡的啼叫，她披着旧袄，顾不得洗漱便走向田地。母亲出生在这个农家，她承袭了农民的淳朴与勤劳。天还蒙蒙亮的时候，她便开始了一天的劳作，谁能想到，这样一个瘦弱的身躯竟撑起了整个家庭的希望。,易,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字讲述了母亲在北平一个小村庄的艰苦生活经历。作者描述了母亲出身农家，勤俭诚实，并在父亲早逝后独力养育家庭的艰辛。母亲不仅勤勉工作，还教会了作者许多良好习惯。尽管生活贫困，母亲仍热情好客，乐于助人，并且从未与人争吵。与姑母的矛盾和母亲在姑母去世后的反应，也展现了母亲一生的忍耐和无私。,1549

"其实，当初坚持要去撒哈拉沙漠的人是我，而不是荷西。
后来长期留了下来，又是为了荷西，不是为了我。我的半生，飘流过很多国家。高度文明的社会，我住过，看透，也尝够了，我的感动不是没有，我的生活方式，多多少少也受到它们的影响。但是我始终没有在一个固定的地方，将我的心也留下来给我居住的城市。
不记得在哪一年以前，我无意间翻到了一本美国的《国家地理杂志》，那期书里，它正好在介绍撒哈拉沙漠。我只看了一遍，我不能解释的，属于前世回忆似的乡愁，就莫名其妙，毫无保留的交给了那一片陌生的大地。
等我再回到西班牙来定居时，因为撒哈拉沙漠还有一片二十八万平方公里的地方，是西国的属地，我怀念渴想往它奔去的欲·望就又一度在苦痛着我了。
这种情怀，在我认识的人里面，几乎被他们视为一个笑话。
我常常说，我要去沙漠走一趟，却没有人当我是在说真的。
也有比较了解我的朋友，他们又将我的向往沙漠，解释成看破红尘，自我放逐，一去不返也——这些都不是很正确的看法。
等我给自己排好时间，预备去沙漠住一年时，除了我的父亲鼓励我之外，另外只有一个朋友，他不笑话我，也不阻止我，更不拖累我。他，默默的收拾了行李，先去沙漠的磷矿公司找到了事，安定下来，等我单独去非洲时好照顾我。他知道我是个一意孤行的倔强女子，我不会改变计划的。
在这个人为了爱情去沙漠里受苦时，我心里已经决定要跟他天涯海角一辈子流浪下去了。
那个人，就是我现在的丈夫荷西。","那是一张泛黄的《国家地理杂志》，搁浅在书架的一角。某个闲散的午后，我随手翻开了它，却被一幅撒哈拉沙漠的照片深深吸引。这片广袤无垠的沙海，有如梦境般笼罩在炽热的阳光里，勾起了我内心深处的一种无法解释的眷恋。我不知道自己为什么会如此迷恋那片荒芜的土地，但从那一刻起，我知道，我必须去亲眼见一见它，亲身感受它的魅力。就这样，这种牵动人心的向往，成了我生活中的一盏明灯，引导着我的步伐向那未知的远方迈进。 

然而，我的梦想却并未得到周围人的理解。朋友们总是笑称我是疯子，甚至连最亲近的家人也认为这是我自我放逐的荒唐念头。我仍然清晰记得母亲望着我的眼神，充满了困惑与不解。“撒哈拉沙漠？你究竟在脑子里拉什么呢？”她的声音充满了无奈。可是，我心中的那团火焰始终没有熄灭，反而因为这些否定的声音燃烧得更为炽烈。 

世俗的眼光和这些反对的声音让我心灰意冷，但有一个人始终站在我这一边，那就是我的丈夫荷西。他是少数几个从未嘲笑我梦想的人，相反，他总是给予我无尽的理解和支持。他笑着对我说：“也许，撒哈拉沙漠是你命中注定的归宿。”听到这样的话，我感到一股温暖涌上心头，仿佛找到了人生中最坚实的后盾。 

终于，我的追梦之路迎来了转机。荷西在撒哈拉沙漠的磷矿公司找到了一份工作，这是他为了实现我的梦想而做出的巨大努力。尽管这意味着我们要离开现有的舒适生活，进入那片人烟稀少的荒野，他却义无反顾，只为了能陪在我身边，照顾我。 

在那一刻，我决定扑向这个梦，与荷西一起流浪，即便前路布满艰辛与挑战。我们收拾好行装，辞别旧日的生活，踏上了前往撒哈拉的旅途。车轮碾过的每一寸土地，都仿佛在提醒我们：梦想就在前方。 

沙漠的日子虽然艰苦，但我从未感到孤单，因为有荷西相伴。无论是炙热的阳光，还是寒冷的夜晚，我们都携手共度，如同这片土地上的一对坚韧的骆驼。撒哈拉沙漠，那片曾经只能在梦中出现的地方，现在终于真实地展现在眼前。 

我的心在这片沙海中找到了归宿，而我的爱情，也在这里得到了升华。面对无尽的风沙，我和荷西紧紧相依，共同铭刻下我们那段与撒哈拉的动人故事。",易,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字描述了作者的心路历程以及她与丈夫荷西的关系。作者对撒哈拉沙漠有一种无法解释的眷恋，这种情怀源于她翻阅《国家地理杂志》后对撒哈拉的向往。尽管她的这种想法被周围的人认为是笑话或自我放逐，但她仍坚定不移地追求。最终，只有荷西理解并支持她，并且在撒哈拉沙漠磷矿公司找到工作，等待作者到来以照顾她。于是，作者决定跟随荷西流浪，二人携手共度一生。,609
"其实，当初坚持要去撒哈拉沙漠的人是我，而不是荷西。
后来长期留了下来，又是为了荷西，不是为了我。我的半生，飘流过很多国家。高度文明的社会，我住过，看透，也尝够了，我的感动不是没有，我的生活方式，多多少少也受到它们的影响。但是我始终没有在一个固定的地方，将我的心也留下来给我居住的城市。
不记得在哪一年以前，我无意间翻到了一本美国的《国家地理杂志》，那期书里，它正好在介绍撒哈拉沙漠。我只看了一遍，我不能解释的，属于前世回忆似的乡愁，就莫名其妙，毫无保留的交给了那一片陌生的大地。

"北平的洋车夫有许多派：年轻力壮，腿脚灵利的，讲究赁漂亮的车，拉“整天儿”，爱什么时候出车与收车都有自由；拉出车来，在固定的“车口”①或宅门一放，专等坐快车的主儿；弄好了，也许一下子弄个一块两块的；碰巧了，也许白耗一天，连“车份儿”也没着落，但也不在乎。这一派哥儿们的希望大概有两个：或是拉包车；或是自己买上辆车，有了自己的车，再去拉包月或散座就没大关系了，反正车是自己的。

比这一派岁数稍大的，或因身体的关系而跑得稍差点劲的，或因家庭的关系而不敢白耗一天的，大概就多数的拉八成新的车；人与车都有相当的漂亮，所以在要价儿的时候也还能保持住相当的尊严。这派的车夫，也许拉“整天”，也许拉“半天”。在后者的情形下，因为还有相当的精气神，所以无论冬天夏天总是“拉晚儿”②。夜间，当然比白天需要更多的留神与本事；钱自然也多挣一些。

年纪在四十以上，二十以下的，恐怕就不易在前两派里有个地位了。他们的车破，又不敢“拉晚儿”，所以只能早早的出车，希望能从清晨转到午后三四点钟，拉出“车份儿”和自己的嚼谷①。他们的车破，跑得慢，所以得多走路，少要钱。到瓜市，果市，菜市，去拉货物，都是他们；钱少，可是无须快跑呢。

在这里，二十岁以下的——有的从十一二岁就干这行儿——很少能到二十岁以后改变成漂亮的车夫的，因为在幼年受了伤，很难健壮起来。他们也许拉一辈子洋车，而一辈子连拉车也没出过风头。那四十以上的人，有的是已拉了十年八年的车，筋肉的衰损使他们甘居人后，他们渐渐知道早晚是一个跟头会死在马路上。他们的拉车姿式，讲价时的随机应变，走路的抄近绕远，都足以使他们想起过去的光荣，而用鼻翅儿扇着那些后起之辈。可是这点光荣丝毫不能减少将来的黑暗，他们自己也因此在擦着汗的时节常常微叹。不过，以他们比较另一些四十上下岁的车夫，他们还似乎没有苦到了家。这一些是以前决没想到自己能与洋车发生关系，而到了生和死的界限已经不甚分明，才抄起车把来的。被撤差的巡警或校役，把本钱吃光的小贩，或是失业的工匠，到了卖无可卖，当无可当的时候，咬着牙，含着泪，上了这条到死亡之路。这些人，生命最鲜壮的时期已经卖掉，现在再把窝窝头变成的血汗滴在马路上。没有力气，没有经验，没有朋友，就是在同行的当中也得不到好气儿。他们拉最破的车，皮带不定一天泄多少次气；一边拉着人还得一边儿央求人家原谅，虽然十五个大铜子儿已经算是甜买卖。

此外，因环境与知识的特异，又使一部分车夫另成派别。生于西苑海甸的自然以走西山，燕京，清华，较比方便；同样，在安定门外的走清河，北苑；在永定门外的走南苑……这是跑长趟的，不愿拉零座；因为拉一趟便是一趟，不屑于三五个铜子的穷凑了。可是他们还不如东交民巷的车夫的气儿长，这些专拉洋买卖①的讲究一气儿由交民巷拉到玉泉山，颐和园或西山。气长也还算小事，一般车夫万不能争这项生意的原因，大半还是因为这些吃洋饭的有点与众不同的知识，他们会说外国话。英国兵，法国兵，所说的万寿山，雍和宫，“八大胡同”，他们都晓得。他们自己有一套外国话，不传授给别人。他们的跑法也特别，四六步儿不快不慢，低着头，目不旁视的，贴着马路边儿走，带出与世无争，而自有专长的神气。因为拉着洋人，他们可以不穿号坎，而一律的是长袖小白褂，白的或黑的裤子，裤筒特别肥，脚腕上系着细带；脚上是宽双脸千层底青布鞋；干净，利落，神气。一见这样的服装，别的车夫不会再过来争座与赛车，他们似乎是属于另一行业的。",北平的街道在晨曦中逐渐显露出清晰的轮廓，北平洋车夫们的忙碌却早已开始。清晨五点，天还未完全亮，街上已经有了一些身影，拉车声和人们之间简短的招呼声交织在一起。他们的生活从一开始就充满了奔波与忙碌，仿佛整个城市的脉搏都在他们的奔波中跳动着。街角的大榕树下，几位年轻力壮的洋车夫正在热情地讨论着昨晚的拉车经历。他们大多租用了城市里最漂亮的车子，车窗油亮，扶手锃光瓦亮，轮子在阳光的照射下闪闪发光。他们以顽强的体力和灵活的身手，能够自由地选择工作时间。当繁忙的公事包和散漫的游客成了他们的常客，他们的收入也相对较高。这些年轻的车夫总是显得朝气蓬勃，做着在某一天拥有自己车子的美梦。稍远一点的地方，一些稍年长的车夫已经开始了他们一天的劳作。他们的车也显得崭新，只是个人的精神状态上略显疲倦。他们有的是因为家庭负担而不得不持续拉车，有的是因为身体原因无法应对更高强度的工作。不管怎样，他们在收入上也能勉强过得去。这些人选择全天或者半天的工作方式，以便在劳作的同时稍稍平衡生活的压力。比起前者，那些年纪更长或者非常年轻的车夫们，则显得更加无奈。他们的车子大多老旧且不堪重负，透出一种岁月的艰辛。这些车夫主要是用来拉货物，每天从清晨开始，一直工作到下午。他们中的一些人经验丰富，心态平和，但更多的人则因为体力不支或者背后沉重的包袱而显得疲惫不堪。回想起昨天车上的货物，他们的每一步都像是承载了整个家庭的期望。同时，在北平这个繁华的城市里，还有一群特殊的车夫。他们的生活轨迹与其他车夫大不相同。由于特定的环境和知识背景，他们主要拉外国客人，熟练掌握几门外语，穿着也独具特色。与其说他们是洋车夫，不如说更像是一个特别的行业人士。他们的工作看起来更有条理，收入也略高，但相应的来自异文化的挑战和压力，也时刻紧跟其后。一天的工作即将结束。街上，匆匆而过的还有一些因为生活窘迫，被迫从事这份工作的洋车夫们。他们没有经验，没有体力，收入也最低。每天面对的是没有希望的奔波和来自生活的重重压力。站在北平的大街上，不同车夫的形象交错重叠，仿佛是这座城市最深处的一块拼图。年轻的车夫们活力四射，追逐着美好的梦想；年长的车夫们沉稳内敛，承载着家庭的期望；那些特殊的车夫们，他们穿梭于不同文化之间，每一步都充满了未知。这个城市，有干净的街道，也有寂寞的小巷。每一辆洋车的背后，都有一个故事，一个在平凡中追逐希望的故事。无论是青春的活力，还是老练的沉静，这些洋车夫都是北平街巷中不可或缺的一部分。夜幕降临，北平的街道再次静下来。而洋车夫们的白日梦，即使只是短暂的安宁，也是他们继续前行的动力。本质上，他们的生活并不孤立于这座城市之外，而是与这城市的脉搏时刻相连。他们的每一次喘息，每一步前行，都在为这座城市输入新的活力。生活继续，洋车夫们在新的一天中，再次踏上了他们的旅程。,易,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字描述了北平的洋车夫的不同群体和他们的工作状况和生活习惯。文章将洋车夫大致分为几类：年轻力壮、腿脚灵活的车夫，他们通常租漂亮的车子，工作时间自由，有望通过拉包车或者拥有自己的车来增加收入；次一类是稍年长或因家庭和身体原因而不能冒风险浪费一天时间的车夫，他们也拉相对新车，可以选择拉全天或半天的活；年纪更长或更年轻的车夫则大多拉破旧的车子，主要是拉货物，工作时间从清晨到下午。还有一部分车夫因为生活所迫，被迫从事这份工作，他们没有经验和体力，收入最低。最后是一些因特殊环境和知识而形成的独特群体，如专拉洋买卖的车夫，他们常拉外国客人并掌握一些外语，有着特别的穿着和跑法，这让他们看起来像是另一行业的人。,1417

"现在我才想到，当年我总是独自跑到地坛去，曾经给母亲出了一个怎样的难。

她不是那种光会疼爱儿子而不懂得理解儿子的母亲。她知道我心里的苦闷，知道不该阻止我出去走走，知道我要是老呆在家里结果会更糟，但她又担心我一个人在那荒僻的园子里整天都想些什么。我那时脾气坏到极点，经常是发了疯一样地离开家，从那园子里回来又中了魔似的什么话都不说。母亲知道有些事不宜问，便犹犹豫豫地想问而终于不敢问，因为她自己心里也没有答案。她料想我不会愿意她限我一同去，所以她从未这样要求过，她知道得给我一点独处的时间，得有这样一段过程。她只是不知道这过程得要多久，和这过程的尽头究竟是什么。每次我要动身时，她便无言地帮我准备，帮助我上了轮椅车，看着我摇车拐出小院；这以后她会怎样，当年我不曾想过。

有一回我摇车出了小院；想起一件什么事又返身回来，看见母亲仍站在原地，还是送我走时的姿势，望着我拐出小院去的那处墙角，对我的回来竟一时没有反应。待她再次送我出门的时候，她说：“出去活动活动，去地坛看看书，我说这挺好。”许多年以后我才渐渐听出，母亲这话实际上是自我安慰，是暗自的祷告，是给我的提示，是恳求与嘱咐。只是在她猝然去世之后，我才有余暇设想。当我不在家里的那些漫长的时间，她是怎样心神不定坐卧难宁，兼着痛苦与惊恐与一个母亲最低限度的祈求。现在我可以断定，以她的聪慧和坚忍，在那些空落的白天后的黑夜，在那不眠的黑夜后的白天，她思来想去最后准是对自己说：“反正我不能不让他出去，未来的日子是他自己的，如果他真的要在那园子里出了什么事，这苦难也只好我来承担。”在那段日子里——那是好几年长的一段日子，我想我一定使母亲作过了最坏的准备了，但她从来没有对我说过：“你为我想想”。事实上我也真的没为她想过。那时她的儿子，还太年轻，还来不及为母亲想，他被命运击昏了头，一心以为自己是世上最不幸的一个，不知道儿子的不幸在母亲那儿总是要加倍的。她有一个长到二十岁上忽然截瘫了的儿子，这是她唯一的儿子；她情愿截瘫的是自己而不是儿子，可这事无法代替；她想，只要儿子能活下去哪怕自己去死呢也行，可她又确信一个人不能仅仅是活着，儿子得有一条路走向自己的幸福；而这条路呢，没有谁能保证她的儿子终于能找到。——这样一个母亲，注定是活得最苦的母亲。

有一次与一个作家朋友聊天，我问他学写作的最初动机是什么？他想了一会说：“为我母亲。为了让她骄傲。”我心里一惊，良久无言。回想自己最初写小说的动机，虽不似这位朋友的那般单纯，但如他一样的愿望我也有，且一经细想，发现这愿望也在全部动机中占了很大比重。这位朋友说：“我的动机太低俗了吧？”我光是摇头，心想低俗并不见得低俗，只怕是这愿望过于天真了。他又说：“我那时真就是想出名，出了名让别人羡慕我母亲。”我想，他比我坦率。我想，他又比我幸福，因为他的母亲还活着。而且我想，他的母亲也比我的母亲运气好，他的母亲没有一个双腿残废的儿子，否则事情就不这么简单。

在我的头一篇小说发表的时候，在我的小说第一次获奖的那些日子里，我真是多么希望我的母亲还活着。我便又不能在家里呆了，又整天整天独自跑到地坛去，心里是没头没尾的沉郁和哀怨，走遍整个园子却怎么也想不通：母亲为什么就不能再多活两年？为什么在她儿子就快要碰撞开一条路的时候，她却忽然熬不住了？莫非她来此世上只是为了替儿子担忧，却不该分享我的一点点快乐？她匆匆离我去时才只有四十九呀！有那么一会，我甚至对世界对上帝充满了仇恨和厌恶。后来我在一篇题为“合欢树”的文章中写道：“我坐在小公园安静的树林里，闭上眼睛，想，上帝为什么早早地召母亲回去呢？很久很久，迷迷糊溯的我听见了回答：”她心里太苦了，上帝看她受不住了，就召她回去。‘我似乎得了一点安慰，睁开眼睛，看见风正从树林里穿过。“小公园，指的也是地坛。
只是到了这时候，纷纭的往事才在我眼前幻现得清晰，母亲的苦难与伟大才在我心中渗透得深彻。上帝的考虑，也许是对的。

摇着轮椅在园中慢慢走，又是雾罩的清晨，又是骄阳高悬的白昼，我只想着一件事：母亲已经不在了。在老柏树旁停下，在草地上在颓墙边停下，又是处处虫鸣的午后，又是乌儿归巢的傍晚，我心里只默念着一句话：可是母亲已经不在了。把椅背放倒，躺下，似睡非睡挨到日没，坐起来，心神恍惚，呆呆地直坐到古祭坛上落满黑暗然后再渐渐浮起月光，心里才有点明白，母亲不能再来这园中找我了。
曾有过好多回，我在这园子里呆得太久了，母亲就来找我。她来找我又不想让我发觉，只要见我还好好地在这园子里，她就悄

悄转身回去，我看见过几次她的背影。我也看见过几回她四处张望的情景，她视力不好，端着眼镜像在寻找海上的一条船，她没看见我时我已经看见她了，待我看见她也看见我了我就不去看她，过一会我再抬头看她就又看见她缓缓离去的背影。我单是无法知道有多少回她没有找到我。有一回我坐在矮树丛中，树丛很密，我看见她没有找到我；她一个人在园子里走，走过我的身旁，走过我经常呆的一些地方，步履茫然又急迫。我不知道她已经找了多久还要找多久，我不知道为什么我决意不喊她——但这绝不是小时候的捉迷藏，这也许是出于长大了的男孩子的倔强或羞涩？但这倔只留给我痛侮，丝毫也没有骄傲。我真想告诫所有长大了的男孩子，千万不要跟母亲来这套倔强，羞涩就更不必，我已经懂了可我已经来不及了。

儿子想使母亲骄傲，这心情毕竟是太真实了，以致使“想出名”这一声名狼藉的念头也多少改变了一点形象。这是个复杂的问题，且不去管它了罢。随着小说获奖的激动逐日暗淡，我开始相信，至少有一点我是想错了：我用纸笔在报刊上碰撞开的一条路，并不就是母亲盼望我找到的那条路。年年月月我都到这园子里来，年年月月我都要想，母亲盼望我找到的那条路到底是什么。

母亲生前没给我留下过什么隽永的哲言，或要我恪守的教诲，只是在她去世之后，她艰难的命运，坚忍的意志和毫不张扬的爱，随光阴流转，在我的印象中愈加鲜明深刻。

有一年，十月的风又翻动起安详的落叶，我在园中读书，听见两个散步的老人说：“没想到这园子有这么大。”我放下书，想，这么大一座园子，要在其中找到她的儿子，母亲走过了多少焦灼的路。多年来我头一次意识到，这园中不单是处处都有过我的车辙，有过我的车辙的地万也都有过母亲的脚印。","地坛，这个古老而宁静的园子，曾经是我生活的避难所。四季轮回，岁月更迭，这里的一草一木都见证了我独自生活的岁月。当我静坐在这片绿荫下，仿佛还能听见母亲的叹息，她的影子在我心底挥之不去，依旧鲜明得让我心痛。母亲的爱就像这地坛的风，润物细无声，却又深沉厚重，几乎压得我喘不过气来。

那段时光，我常常一个人漫步在地坛的石径上，迷失在自我的思想中。每当我坐在石凳上，仰望天空，我知道，母亲的目光始终追随着我。她不曾对我说过一句责备的话，但我感受到她那深藏在内心的痛苦。每当我摇着轮椅回家，看到她那操劳的身影，心中总是隐隐作痛。她不愿让我看见她的忧伤，总是用微笑掩饰内心的恐惧和不安。

母亲在我截瘫后的每一天，都过得无比艰难。她从未向我诉说她的辛劳和痛苦，只是默默地承担着一切。每当我看见她熬夜为我按摩，为我做康复训练，心中的愧疚和无奈便如同潮水般涌来。我知道，她的内心承受着常人难以想象的巨大压力。她的身体一天天消瘦，满头乌发逐渐化为银丝，那一刻，我突然意识到，她为我付出的，不仅仅是时间和精力，还有她的生命。

母亲终于在一个寒冷的冬夜，永远地离开了我。那一夜，我坐在她的床前，泪流满面。她的面容安详，仿佛在笑，我知道，她的心终于不再为我操劳，不再为我忧愁。她离开了她一生挚爱的儿子，她给予我的爱，永远无法用言语表达。

母亲去世后，我常常一个人到地坛去，回忆她的一言一行，一笑一泪。那些点点滴滴的记忆，如同一幅幅温暖的画面，深深烙印在我的心中。每当我在园子里徘徊，总能感觉到她的存在，她的爱和牵挂从未离开。

时光荏苒，我逐渐长大，成名，成为一名作家，取得了一些成就。然而，这些成就并未能让我内心的空虚感得到填补。我开始思考母亲到底希望我成为怎样的人。我明白，母亲希望我过上幸福美满的生活，希望我能够快乐，而不仅仅是事业上的成功。

我在地坛的树下反复思量，母爱的含义愈发深刻。母亲的爱不仅仅是表面的温柔和关怀，更是一种深沉复杂的情感。她把所有的希望和爱都倾注在我的身上，无怨无悔地为我付出一切。她知道，我在人生道路上会遇到种种困难和挑战，但她始终相信，我能够自强不息，走出困境。

如今，我坐在地坛的旧石凳上，思考着人生的意义。母亲留给我的，不仅是难以抹去的回忆，还有一份永恒的爱。这份爱将指引我走向未来的每一步，激励我在困境中奋勇前行。我明白，母亲希望我快乐，希望我幸福，这才是她最大的心愿。

在这片宁静的园子里，我再次体悟到母爱的伟大与坚忍。她用她的一生，向我诠释了什么是真正的爱。那是一种无私的，不求回报的深厚感情。我将带着这份爱，继续前行，不辜负她的期望。

或许有一天，我也会像母亲一样，成为孩子们的守护者，用我的爱与包容，去呵护他们，陪伴他们成长。不论风雨，我会坚定地站在他们身后，因为我知道，母爱，是世界上最坚韧，最无私的力量。",易,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字描写了作者在地坛独自生活的岁月里，母亲对他充满关怀和担忧的心情。作者描述了母亲在他外出时无言的支持和内心的痛苦，以及她在作者截瘫后所承受的巨大心理负担。母亲因操劳和担忧去世后，作者回忆母亲的爱和牵挂，感叹自己当时的年少无知和母亲的伟大与坚忍。最终，作者意识到他努力写作取得的成就，并不是母亲真正期盼的道路，他在园子里不断反思母亲的愿望，体悟到母爱深沉复杂的情感。,2535
"现在我才想到，当年我总是独自跑到地坛去，曾经给母亲出了一个怎样的难。

她不是那种光会疼爱儿子而不懂得理解儿子的母亲。她知道我心里的苦闷，知道不该阻止我出去走走，知道我要是老呆在家里结果会更糟，但她又担心我一个人在那荒僻的园子里整天都想些什么。我那时脾气坏到极点，经常是发了疯一样地离开家，从那园子里回来又中了魔似的什么话都不说。母亲知道有些事不宜问，便犹犹豫豫地想问而终于不敢问，因为她自己心里也没有答案。她料想我不会愿意她限我一同去，所以她从未这样要求过，她知道得给我一点独处的时间，得有这样一段过程。她只是不知道这过程得要多久，和这过程的尽头究竟是什么。每次我要动身时，她便无言地帮我准备，帮助我上了轮椅车，看着我摇车拐出小院；这以后她会怎样，当年我不曾想过。

有一回我摇车出了小院；想起一件什么事又返身回来，看见母亲仍站在原地，还是送我走时的姿势，望着我拐出小院去的那处墙角，对我的回来竟一时没有反应。待她再次送我出门的时候，她说：“出去活动活动，去地坛看看书，我说这挺好。”许多年以后我才渐渐听出，母亲这话实际上是自我安慰，是暗自的祷告，是给我的提示，是恳求与嘱咐。只是在她猝然去世之后，我才有余暇设想。当我不在家里的那些漫长的时间，她是怎样心神不定坐卧难宁，兼着痛苦与惊恐与一个母亲最低限度的祈求。现在我可以断定，以她的聪慧和坚忍，在那些空落的白天后的黑夜，在那不眠的黑夜后的白天，她思来想去最后准是对自己说：“反正我不能不让他出去，未来的日子是他自己的，如果他真的要在那园子里出了什么事，这苦难也只好我来承担。”在那段日子里——那是好几年长的一段日子，我想我一定使母亲作过了最坏的准备了，但她从来没有对我说过：“你为我想想”。事实上我也真的没为她想过。那时她的儿子，还太年轻，还来不及为母亲想，他被命运击昏了头，一心以为自己是世上最不幸的一个，不知道儿子的不幸在母亲那儿总是要加倍的。她有一个长到二十岁上忽然截瘫了的儿子，这是她唯一的儿子；她情愿截瘫的是自己而不是儿子，可这事无法代替；她想，只要儿子能活下去哪怕自己去死呢也行，可她又确信一个人不能仅仅是活着，儿子得有一条路走向自己的幸福；而这条路呢，没有谁能保证她的儿子终于能找到。——这样一个母亲，注定是活得最苦的母亲。

有一次与一个作家朋友聊天，我问他学写作的最初动机是什么？他想了一会说：“为我母亲。为了让她骄傲。”我心里一惊，良久无言。回想自己最初写小说的动机，虽不似这位朋友的那般单纯，但如他一样的愿望我也有，且一经细想，发现这愿望也在全部动机中占了很大比重。这位朋友说：“我的动机太低俗了吧？”我光是摇头，心想低俗并不见得低俗，只怕是这愿望过于天真了。他又说：“我那时真就是想出名，出了名让别人羡慕我母亲。”我想，他比我坦率。我想，他又比我幸福，因为他的母亲还活着。而且我想，他的母亲也比我的母亲运气好，他的母亲没有一个双腿残废的儿子，否则事情就不这么简单。

在我的头一篇小说发表的时候，在我的小说第一次获奖的那些日子里，我真是多么希望我的母亲还活着。我便又不能在家里呆了，又整天整天独自跑到地坛去，心里是没头没尾的沉郁和哀怨，走遍整个园子却怎么也想不通：母亲为什么就不能再多活两年？为什么在她儿子就快要碰撞开一条路的时候，她却忽然熬不住了？莫非她来此世上只是为了替儿子担忧，却不该分享我的一点点快乐？她匆匆离我去时才只有四十九呀！有那么一会，我甚至对世界对上帝充满了仇恨和厌恶。后来我在一篇题为“合欢树”的文章中写道：“我坐在小公园安静的树林里，闭上眼睛，想，上帝为什么早早地召母亲回去呢？很久很久，迷迷糊溯的我听见了回答：”她心里太苦了，上帝看她受不住了，就召她回去。‘我似乎得了一点安慰，睁开眼睛，看见风正从树林里穿过。“小公园，指的也是地坛。
只是到了这时候，纷纭的往事才在我眼前幻现得清晰，母亲的苦难与伟大才在我心中渗透得深彻。上帝的考虑，也许是对的。

摇着轮椅在园中慢慢走，又是雾罩的清晨，又是骄阳高悬的白昼，我只想着一件事：母亲已经不在了。在老柏树旁停下，在草地上在颓墙边停下，又是处处虫鸣的午后，又是乌儿归巢的傍晚，我心里只默念着一句话：可是母亲已经不在了。把椅背放倒，躺下，似睡非睡挨到日没，坐起来，心神恍惚，呆呆地直坐到古祭坛上落满黑暗然后再渐渐浮起月光，心里才有点明白，母亲不能再来这园中找我了。

悄转身回去，我看见过几次她的背影。我也看见过几回她四处张望的情景，她视力不好，端着眼镜像在寻找海上的一条船，她没看见我时我已经看见她了，待我看见她也看见我了我就不去看她，过一会我再抬头看她就又看见她缓缓离去的背影。我单是无法知道有多少回她没有找到我。有一回我坐在矮树丛中，树丛很密，我看见她没有找到我；她一个人在园子里走，走过我的身旁，走过我经常呆的一些地方，步履茫然又急迫。我不知道她已经找了多久还要找多久，我不知道为什么我决意不喊她——但这绝不是小时候的捉迷藏，这也许是出于长大了的男孩子的倔强或羞涩？但这倔只留给我痛侮，丝毫也没有骄傲。我真想告诫所有长大了的男孩子，千万不要跟母亲来这套倔强，羞涩就更不必，我已经懂了可我已经来不及了。

回来洗了手，桌上已摆好了三个凉菜，又开启了几瓶罐头，庄之蝶自然坐了上席。夏捷喝自带的桂花稠酒，孟云房只享用杏仁果露，周敏就捧满盅白酒敬道：“庄老师，您是西京名人，更是咱潼关人的骄傲，学生蒙您关照到了编辑部，这恩德终生不敢忘的。今日我要说的，是为了去编辑部，其中有些做法不妥，假借了您的名分写条儿，还望老师谅解。至于写您的那篇文章，我才学着写的，让您见笑了。”庄之蝶说：“事情已经办成了，就不必那么说了。那篇文章我也没看，现在写这样文章的人多，虽说是宣传我，可也是人家的文章。以前有人写了让我看，我看了主张不发表，可人家最后还是发表了，写文章的人都有发表欲嘛，所以后来这类文章我都不看。”周敏说：“老师这么大度，真是意想不到，那就受学生一敬，满喝了吧！”之蝶接过仰脖喝了，说：“孟哥你真的戒了？”孟云房说：“当然戒了。”庄之蝶说，“这何必呢？咱们学习佛呀道呀的，主要是从哲学美学方面去借鉴些东西罢了，别降格到民间老太太那样的烧香磕头。其实寺庙里的那些和尚、尼姑也是一种职业。”孟云房说：”这你就不懂了，不在局中，不知局情。练气功不戒酒肉葱蒜，气感就不上身；有了功能，吃酒肉葱蒜又不舒服。”庄之蝶说：“修炼修炼，世上真正的高人都是修出来的，只有徒子徒孙才整日练的。”唐宛儿嗤嗤发笑，众人看她时，却抿了抿嘴，拧头看窗外的那株梨树，梨树举着满枝绿叶，弯曲苍老的身子上有一个洞。庄之蝶看见唐宛儿神情很美，问道：“你要说什么的？”唐宛儿说：“你们说学问的，我听个热闹。”孟云房说：“什么学问！我们常抬杠惯了，我现在越来越和他想不到一块了。”庄之蝶说：“我是觉得你爱走极端化，说戒酒就戒了，这意志我做不到。可滴酒就不沾了？这可是真正的‘五粮液’哩！”孟云房说：“是茅台，也不喝的！”夏捷已经自个喝了一碗稠酒，又喊周敏倒了一碗，说：“之蝶你才说对了，他一生就是吃了走极端的亏！你来西京时，他已出了名的，可这些年了，你一片煌辉灿烂了，他还是他。现在文章也写得少了，整日价参佛呀，练功呀，不吃这不吃那，也害得我寡汤寡水的肚里没有了油！”周敏说：“这就叫孟老师没口福。世上那些个体户做生意的，福而不贵；孟老师贵而不福。”孟云房说：“这话是对的，你庄老师福贵双全，活到这个份上，要啥有啥地风光！”庄之蝶听了，定睛看从窗棂里射进来照在菜盘上的光柱，光柱里有活活的物浮动，脸上就是一丝苦笑，说：“是什么都有了，可我需要破缺。”孟云房一怔，问道：“你说什么？”庄之蝶又重复了一遍：“破缺。”孟云房说：“我现在也难吃摸透你了。说实话，你能去啤酒厂那么长的时间我没有想到，近日在报纸上写的那些文章似乎观念也大不同了以前。”庄之蝶说：“我也吃惊过我自己，是顺应了社会，还是在堕落了。”孟云房说：“这我不能结论，怕就像我怎么迷上气功要戒酒戒肉一样吧，一切都是生命的自然流动，如水加热后必然会出现对称破缺的自组织现象。”两个人这么说着，周敏和唐宛儿就听得似懂非懂，虽然还在笑着，笑得僵硬。夏捷就啧啧啧地咂着口舌，说：“孟云房同志，今日是被人请了来吃酒的，不是开学术会，你们别贩卖那些名词。”庄之蝶就挥挥手，说：“不说了不说了，咱们喝酒吧。”端起杯自个就喝了。,"在城市的夜幕下，一间灯光温暖的餐厅内，五位老友齐聚一堂，他们分别是庄之蝶、孟云房、周敏、夏捷和唐宛儿。这是一场久违的聚餐，餐桌上摆满了丰盛的菜肴，空气中弥漫着美食的香气，承载着他们之间多年的情谊和难得的叙旧时光。 

庄之蝶是这次聚会的主角之一，他坐在餐桌的中央，微笑着看着周围的朋友。周敏举起酒杯，向庄之蝶表示感谢：“庄老师，这些年多亏了您的关照，我才有今天的成就。这杯酒我敬您，也向您赔个礼，是我以前做事考虑不周，冒犯了您。” 

庄之蝶微微一笑，举起酒杯与她碰了一下，轻松地说道：“周敏，你太客气了。我们都是老朋友了，说这些做什么？”他一饮而尽，然后放下酒杯，看向孟云房。 

孟云房此时正专注地将一盘蔬菜沙拉拌匀。他的面前没有任何酒水，只有一杯清水。周敏开玩笑道：“孟大哥，这年头，谁还戒酒戒肉呢？你当真打算一辈子只吃这些清淡的东西？” 

孟云房点点头，平静地回答：“是啊，我已经戒酒戒肉有几年了。从练气功开始，我发现清淡的饮食更有助于身心的平衡与健康。” 

庄之蝶闻言，皱了皱眉说道：“云房，凡事不必走极端。生命本身是自然的流动，我们何必要给自己设限呢？适度的享受生活也是一种健康。” 

夏捷附和道：“庄老师说得对。我们并不是说不支持你的生活方式，但凡事还是要有个度。” 

周敏也有些担忧地看着孟云房，“是啊，云房。我们都希望你健康快乐。不必把生活弄得太刻板。” 

唐宛儿，这位一直安静聆听的朋友，也发表了自己的看法：“我觉得每个人的选择都是值得尊重的。云房有他的坚持和追求，我们能做的，应当是理解和支持。” 

餐桌上的气氛稍稍有些沉默，大家都各持己见。 

庄之蝶沉思片刻后，缓缓开口：“其实我们每个人都有不同的生活哲学，我并不是反对健康的生活方式，只是担心这样极端的尝试会不会让我们失去了生活本该有的美好。顺应自然、适度而行，也是一种智慧。” 

孟云房笑了笑，看着庄之蝶：“你说的也有道理。其实我选择这种生活方式，也是为了更好地修炼自己。不过，听了你们的话，我会慎重考虑的，或许适度地放松一下，也是种调剂。” 

话题在轻松的氛围中继续流转，夏捷讲起了最近工作中的趣事，唐宛儿则分享了一些生活的微小幸福。大家时而欢笑，时而沉思，竟是时光静好。 

聚餐接近尾声，庄之蝶看着这群曾经在自己生命中留下重要印记的朋友们，心中感慨颇多。不禁反思：“我是否真的在顺应社会的潮流中逐渐失去了自我？还是说，这也只不过是生命自然的流动？” 

他将这些疑问向孟云房提起，孟云房微笑着答道：“我们每个人在社会中扮演不同的角色，都有各自的追求和挣扎。重要的是，不忘自己的初心，寻找到内心的平衡。” 

庄之蝶点了点头，如有所悟。 

夜色渐深，聚餐也逐渐散场。五位朋友相互拥抱告别，承载着交流后的理解与温暖，各自踏上了回家的路。生活无非是途中的相遇与别离，但这份难得的情谊，却一直在他们的心中流淌，成为生命中最真实的一部分。",易,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,文字叙述了一群朋友聚餐的情景。庄之蝶、孟云房、周敏、夏捷和唐宛儿在饭桌上进行了一些讨论和交流。周敏感谢庄之蝶的关照并敬酒道歉，孟云房提到自己戒酒戒肉的原因缘于练气功，庄之蝶表示不赞同走极端。夏捷和周敏评论了孟云房的生活选择，认为他过于极端。最后，庄之蝶反思自己是否顺应了社会还是在堕落，引发了与孟云房关于生命自然流动的讨论。,1309
回来洗了手，桌上已摆好了三个凉菜，又开启了几瓶罐头，庄之蝶自然坐了上席。夏捷喝自带的桂花稠酒，孟云房只享用杏仁果露，周敏就捧满盅白酒敬道：“庄老师，您是西京名人，更是咱潼关人的骄傲，学生蒙您关照到了编辑部，这恩德终生不敢忘的。今日我要说的，是为了去编辑部，其中有些做法不妥，假借了您的名分写条儿，还望老师谅解。至于写您的那篇文章，我才学着写的，让您见笑了。”庄之蝶说：“事情已经办成了，就不必那么说了。那篇文章我也没看，现在写这样文章的人多，虽说是宣传我，可也是人家的文章。以前有人写了让我看，我看了主张不发表，可人家最后还是发表了，写文章的人都有发表欲嘛，所以后来这类文章我都不看。”周敏说：“老师这么大度，真是意想不到，那就受学生一敬，满喝了吧！”之蝶接过仰脖喝了，说：“孟哥你真的戒了？”孟云房说：“当然戒了。”庄之蝶说，“这何必呢？咱们学习佛呀道呀的，主要是从哲学美学方面去借鉴些东西罢了，别降格到民间老太太那样的烧香磕头。其实寺庙里的那些和尚、尼姑也是一种职业。”孟云房说：”这你就不懂了，不在局中，不知局情。练气功不戒酒肉葱蒜，气感就不上身；有了功能，吃酒肉葱蒜又不舒服。”庄之蝶说：“修炼修炼，世上真正的高人都是修出来的，只有徒子徒孙才整日练的。”唐宛儿嗤嗤发笑，众人看她时，却抿了抿嘴，拧头看窗外的那株梨树，梨树举着满枝绿叶，弯曲苍老的身子上有一个洞。庄之蝶看见唐宛儿神情很美，问道：“你要说什么的？”唐宛儿说：“你们说学问的，我听个热闹。”孟云房说：“什么学问！我们常抬杠惯了，我现在越来越和他想不到一块了。”庄之蝶说：“我是觉得你爱走极端化，说戒酒就戒了，这意志我做不到。可滴酒就不沾了？这可是真正的‘五粮液’哩！”孟云房说：“是茅台，也不喝的！”夏捷已经自个喝了一碗稠酒，又喊周敏倒了一碗，说：“之蝶你才说对了，他一生就是吃了走极端的亏！你来西京时，他已出了名的，可这些年了，你一片煌辉灿烂了，他还是他。现在文章也写得少了，整日价参佛呀，练功呀，不吃这不吃那，也害得我寡汤寡水的肚里没有了油！”周敏说：“这就叫孟老师没口福。世上那些个体户做生意的，福而不贵；孟老师贵而不福。”孟云房说：“这话是对的，你庄老师福贵双全，活到这个份上，要啥有啥地风光！”庄之蝶听了，定睛看从窗棂里射进来照在菜盘上的光柱，光柱里有活活的物浮动，脸上就是一丝苦笑，说：“是什么都有了，可我需要破缺。”孟云房一怔，问道：“你说什么？”庄之蝶又重复了一遍：“破缺。”孟云房说：“我现在也难吃摸透你了。说实话，你能去啤酒厂那么长的时间我没有想到，近日在报纸上写的那些文章似乎观念也大不同了以前。”庄之蝶说：“我也吃惊过我自己，是顺应了社会，还是在堕落了。”孟云房说：“这我不能结论，怕就像我怎么迷上气功要戒酒戒肉一样吧，一切都是生命的自然流动，如水加热后必然会出现对称破缺的自组织现象。”两个人这么说着，周敏和唐宛儿就听得似懂非懂，虽然还在笑着，笑得僵硬。夏捷就啧啧啧地咂着口舌，说：“孟云房同志，今日是被人请了来吃酒的，不是开学术会，你们别贩卖那些名词。”庄之蝶就挥挥手，说：“不说了不说了，咱们喝酒吧。”端起杯自个就喝了。,,,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,文字叙述了一群朋友聚餐的情景。庄之蝶、孟云房、周敏、夏捷和唐宛儿在饭桌上进行了一些讨论和交流。周敏感谢庄之蝶的关照并敬酒道歉，孟云房提到自己戒酒戒肉的原因缘于练气功，庄之蝶表示不赞同走极端。夏捷和周敏评论了孟云房的生活选择，认为他过于极端。最后，庄之蝶反思自己是否顺应了社会还是在堕落，引发了与孟云房关于生命自然流动的讨论。,1309

"巍巍大唐就在前面不远处了，中国，从哪条道路走近它？

很多学者认为，顺着中国文化的原路走下去，就成，迟早能到。

我不同意这种看法，因为事实并不是这样。

走向大唐，需要一股浩荡之气。这气，秦汉帝国曾经有过，尤其在秦始皇和汉武帝身上。但是，秦始皇耗于重重内斗和庞大工程，汉武帝耗于五十余年与匈奴的征战，元气散佚。到了后来骄奢无度又四分五裂的乱世，更是气息奄奄。尽管有魏晋名士、王羲之、陶渊明他们延续着高贵的精神脉络，但是，越高贵也就越隐秘，越不能呼应天下。

这种状态，怎么缔造得了一个大唐？

浩荡之气来自于一种强大的力量。这种力量已经无法从宫廷和文苑产生，只能来自于旷野。

旷野之力，也就是未曾开化的蛮力。未曾开化的蛮力能够参与创建一个伟大的文化盛世吗？这就要看它能不能快速地自我开化。如果它能做到，那么，旷野之力也就可能成为支撑整个文明的脊梁。

中国，及时地获得了这种旷野之力。

二

这种旷野之力，来自大兴安岭北部的东麓。

一个仍然处于原始游牧状态的民族——鲜卑族，其中拓跋氏一支渐有起色。当匈奴在汉武帝的征战下西迁和南移之后，鲜卑拓跋氏来到匈奴故地，以强势与匈奴余部联盟，战胜其他部落，称雄北方，建立王朝，于公元四世纪后期定都于今天的山西大同，当时叫平城。根据一位汉族士人的提议，正式改国号为“魏”，表明已经承接三国魏氏政权而进入中华正统，史称北魏。此后，又经过半个世纪的征战，北魏完成了黄河流域的统一。

胜利，以及胜利后统治范围的扩大，使北魏的鲜卑族首领们不得不投入文化思考。

最明显的问题是：汉族被战胜了，可以任意驱使，但汉族所代表的农耕文明，却不能按游牧文明的规则来任意驱使。要有效地领导农耕文明，必然要抑制豪强兼并，实行均田制、户籍制、赋税制、州郡制，而这些制度又牵动着一系列生活方式和文化形态的重大改革。

要么不改革，让中原沃土废耕为牧，一起走回原始时代；要么改革，让被战胜者的文化来战胜自己，共同走向文明。
鲜卑族的智者们勇敢地选择了后者。这在他们自己内部，当然阻力重重。自大而又脆弱的民族防范心理，一次次变成野蛮的凶杀。有些在他们那里做官的汉人也死得很惨，如崔浩。但是，天佑鲜卑，天佑北魏，天佑中华，这条血迹斑斑的改革之路终于通向了一个结论：汉化！

从公元五世纪后期开始，经由冯太后，到孝文帝拓跋宏，开始实行一系列强有力的汉化措施。先在行政制度、农耕制度上动手，然后快速地把改革推向文化。

孝文帝拓跋宏发布了一系列属于文化范畴的严厉命令。

第一，把首都从山西大同（平城）南迁到河南洛阳。理由是北方的故土更适合游牧式的“武功”，而南方的中原大地更适合“文治”。而所谓“文治”，也就是全面采用汉人的社会管理模式。

第二，禁说鲜卑族的语言，一律改说汉语。年长的官员可以允许有一个适应过程，而三十岁以下的鲜卑族官员如果还说鲜卑话，立即降职处分。

第三，放弃鲜卑民族的传统服饰，颁行按汉民族服饰制定的衣帽样式。

第四，迁到洛阳的鲜卑人，一律把自己的籍贯定为“河南洛阳”，死后葬于洛阳北边的邙山。

第五，改鲜卑部落的名号为汉语单姓。

第六，以汉族礼制改革鲜卑族的原始祭祀形式。

第七，主张鲜卑族与汉族通婚，规定由鲜卑贵族带头，与汉族士族结亲。

……

这么多命令，出自于一个充分掌握了强权的少数民族统治者，而周围并没有人威逼他这么做，这确实太让人惊叹了。我认为，这不仅在中国，而且在世界历史上，也是极为罕见的。",夕阳西下，一抹嫣红浸染天空，这片辽阔的大地似乎在沉寂的岁月中等待一场浩荡之气的来临，那股气势将引领中国走向大唐盛世，但在此之前，像秦汉帝国那样雄浑而强劲的力量必须得以重生。秦汉时代，军马嘶鸣的战场和铮铮铁骨的帝王，曾经让山河震颤，然而，时光流转，这股力量逐渐涣散在岁月的长河中，直至北方的旷野之地，一股新的气息开始汇聚，一个来自鲜卑拓跋氏的王族开始了他们的征战与变革之旅。\n\n拓跋珪，鲜卑拓跋氏领袖，在千军万马的战场上崛起，他的目光透过层层迷雾，看见了自己民族的未来——一个超越草原、融合农耕文明的新生王朝。于是，一场浩大的征战开始了。草原上的战士们骑马奋勇，鲜血染红了大地。在无数个凛冽的冬日和燥热的盛夏后，拓跋珪终于在中原腹地建立起了属于自己的王朝——北魏。\n\n这个新兴的政权不仅仅只是为了占据土地和资源，更重要的是要吸收汉族文化的精华，适应并改造传统的农耕文明。巍峨的宫殿在草原子民的双手中耸立，他们穿上汉人的服饰，说着逐渐熟悉的汉语。拓跋珪深知，仅仅依靠武力与征战无法真正稳固他的统治，他需要通过文化的力量去赢得民心。\n\n迁都是一项重要的改革。从平城迁往洛阳，这不仅是地理位置的改变，更是文化中心的不同。洛阳，那是曾经汉族文明的核心，拥有丰富的历史和深厚的文化底蕴。迁都之后，北魏迅速吸纳了汉文化的各方面成果，无论是制度、法律，还是文学、艺术，都在这片古老而富有生机的土地上焕发出新的光彩。\n\n除了迁都，语言的改变也是汉化改革中的重要一步。拓跋氏开始强制推行汉语作为官方语言，不仅仅是在宫廷内，在行政管理、教育体系中，汉语逐渐成为主流。这种语言上的转变，不仅拉近了鲜卑人与汉人之间的距离，也使得北魏政权在管理中原地区时变得更加顺利和高效。\n\n服饰的改变同样带来了深远的影响。从传统的游牧装束到汉族的衣冠制度，北魏逐渐形成了一套全新的服饰体系。皇帝、贵族到平民百姓，各阶层的服饰都参照汉人的习惯进行，而改良后的服饰，不仅更加符合中原地区的气候和生活习惯，也象征着鲜卑族逐渐融入汉民族的决心和行动。\n\n在社会管理模式上，北魏也进行了全面的改革。沿用汉族的户籍制度、土地政策和科举制度，形成了一套成熟而有效的管理体系。这些改革，不仅稳定了社会秩序，还极大地促进了经济的发展和文化的繁荣。\n\n中原大地上，稻田青青，牛羊成群，人民安居乐业，社会和谐稳定，这些都是北魏汉化改革的成果。在拓跋领导下，北魏逐渐从一个游牧民族转变为一个农耕文明的领导者，这不仅是拓跋氏的胜利，也是中华文明的又一次伟大复兴。\n\n多年后，当夕阳再次染红大地，拓跋珪的后人站在他的陵前，面对那片广袤的原野，心中升腾起无尽的敬意和自豪。拓跋氏的汉化改革，不仅为他们带来了繁荣和力量，更为后世提供了宝贵的经验和智慧。中国，这片土地上的人们，正是通过这样一次次的奋斗和变革，才走向了大唐盛世，迎来了属于他们的新纪元。,易,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字论述了中国在实现大唐盛世之前，需要一股来自旷野的浩荡之气，秦汉帝国曾拥有过，但其后逐渐消散。鲜卑拓跋氏在征战后，建立了北魏王朝，并逐渐进行汉化改革，以适应和领导农耕文明。这些改革包括迁都、改变语言、服饰以及社会管理模式等，最终促进了中华文明的复兴。,1376

"迎面遇见一群洋绅士，众星捧月一般簇拥着一个女人。流苏先就注意到那人的漆黑的长发，结成双股大辫，高高盘在头上。那印度女人，这一次虽然是西式装束，依旧带着浓厚的东方色彩。玄色轻纱氅底下，她穿着金鱼黄紧身长衣，盖住了手，只露出晶亮的指甲。领口挖成极狭的Ｖ形，直开到腰际，那是巴黎最新的款式，有个名式，唤做""一线天""。她的脸色黄而油润，像飞了金的观音菩萨，然而她的影沉沉的大眼睛里躲着妖魔。古典型的直鼻子，只是太尖，太薄一点。粉红的厚重的小嘴唇，仿佛肿着似的。柳原站住了脚，向她微微鞠了一躬。流苏在那里看她，她也昂然望着流苏，那一双骄矜的眼睛，如同隔着几千里地，远远的向人望过来。柳原便介绍道：""这是白小姐。这是萨黑荑妮公主。""流苏不觉肃然起敬。萨黑荑妮伸出一只手来，用指尖碰了一碰流苏的手，问柳原道：""这位白小姐，也是上海来的？""柳原点点头。萨黑荑妮微笑道：""她倒不像上海人。""柳原笑道：""像哪儿的人呢？""萨黑荑妮把一只食指按在腮帮子上，想了一想，翘着十指尖尖，仿佛是要形容而又形容不出的样子，耸肩笑了一笑，往里走去。柳原扶着流苏继续往外走，流苏虽然听不大懂英文，鉴貌辨色，也就明白了，便笑道：""我原是个乡下人。""柳原道：""我刚才对你说过了，你是个道地的中国人，那自然跟她所谓的上海人有点不同。""

他们上了车，柳原又道：""你别看她架子搭得十足。她在外面招摇，说是克力希纳?柯兰姆帕王公的亲生女，只因王妃失宠，赐了死，她也就被放逐了，一直流浪着，不能回国。其实，不能回国倒是真的，其余的，可没有人能够证实。""流苏道：""她到上海去过么？""柳原道：""人家在上海也是很有名的。后来她跟着一个英国人上香港来。你看见她背后那个老头子么？现在就是他养活着她。""流苏笑道：""你们男人就是这样。当面何尝不奉承着她，背后就说得她一个钱不值。像我这样一个穷遗老的女儿，身分还不及她高的人，不知道你对别人怎样的说我呢！""柳原笑道：""谁敢一口气把你们两人的名字说在一起？""流苏撇了撇嘴道：""也许因为她的名字太长了。一口气念不完。""柳原道：""你放心。你是什么样的人，我就拿你当什么样的人看待，准没错。""流苏做出安心的样子，向车窗上一靠，低声道：""真的？""他这句话，似乎并不是挖苦她的，因为她渐渐发觉了，他们单独在一起的时候，他总是斯斯文文的，君子人模样。不知道为什么，他背着人这样稳重，当众却喜欢放肆。她一时摸不清那到底是他的怪脾气，还是他另有作用。","流苏漫步在那条铺满石子的小径上，晚夏的风轻轻拂过，带来一丝清爽。突然，一阵欢声笑语传来，她看到前方不远处有一群洋绅士，披着剪裁得体的西服，佩戴着各式华丽的饰品。他们簇拥着一位衣着独特的女子，引得路人纷纷侧目。这位女子一头乌黑亮丽的长发被精致地盘在脑后，脸上画着恰到好处的妆容，神采奕奕。她那身服饰更是让人无法忽视，巧妙地融合了西方的高贵优雅与东方的温婉华丽，看上去宛如一幅行走的画卷。

流苏的心里忽然升起一丝好奇，她走上前去，赶在洋绅士之前，轻声问道：“请问，您是?”

那位女子面带微笑，礼貌地回答道：“我是萨黑荑妮。”流苏操着一口流利的英语继续询问，“萨黑荑妮小姐，您来自印度？”萨黑荑妮点点头，眼神中带着一丝欣赏，“您猜对了，你是？”

“我叫流苏，刚和朋友们一起吃完午餐，您呢？”

萨黑荑妮微笑道：“我刚抵达，不太熟悉这里。”于是，两人便一同继续往前走，聊了起来。从对话中，流苏了解到萨黑荑妮曾在上海小有名气，现在依靠一位英国老头子的资助优雅地生活。萨黑荑妮轻描淡写地讲述了她的生活，流苏却感觉出其中的不易与复杂。

流苏的心中迷雾重重，她想起了最近与柳原的几次对话，特别是那些令她困惑不已的闲言碎语。她凑近萨黑荑妮，压低声音道：“萨黑荑妮小姐，您能告诉我，如何应对他人的闲言碎语吗？特别是当您在意某个人的看法时。”

萨黑荑妮略微沉思了一下，随后说道：“流苏，每个人都有自己的问题和困惑，你不能让别人的看法定义你的人生。关键是找到真正关心你的人，并与他们坦诚相待。”

这番话如晨钟暮鼓，让流苏心中豁然开朗。然而，她心中依然对柳原抱有一些疑虑：那天她听到柳原在别人的背后议论她，心中的不安久久无法平息。但当她亲自质问柳原时，他却表示会真实对待每个人。流苏有些半信半疑，但他的话语中又似乎有那么一丝真诚。

到了晚上，流苏与柳原单独相处。在这时候，柳原总是表现得很稳重，言语之间充满了大家风范。流苏感受到了他的专注与体贴，这让她在暂时忘却了心中的疑虑，享受那片刻的宁静与安宁。

但每当他们出现在公众场合，柳原的态度又是完全不同的。他显得放肆，甚至有些夸张，言辞行动之间无不带着一种显摆的意味。这种转变让流苏有些纠结，她不知道应如何看待柳原：是他内心深处的真实那部分，还是那放肆外在的表象？

流苏常常独自思考，站在窗前望着远处城市的灯火。这座城市，每时每刻都在变幻，有的像她一样驻足不前，有的却在不断地前行。她知道，自己必须做一个决定，一个关于信任与怀疑的抉择。

夜色深沉，露珠在窗台上凝结成晶莹的水珠，流苏终于找到了答案：不论柳原的真实面目如何，她必须找到自己的位置和归属。她决定与萨黑荑妮多交流，从她那里汲取智慧与勇气，因为真正的答案不在于别人的看法，而在于自己的内心是否足够坚定。",易,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,流苏遇到了一群洋绅士，簇拥着一位印度公主萨黑荑妮。萨黑荑妮身着混合了西方和东方风格的服装。流苏与她见面交谈，了解到她曾在上海有名，现在依靠一位英国老头子生活。流苏对柳原在别人背后议论她感到担忧，但柳原表示会真实对待每个人。在单独相处时，柳原表现得很稳重，但在公众面前却显得放肆。,1007
"迎面遇见一群洋绅士，众星捧月一般簇拥着一个女人。流苏先就注意到那人的漆黑的长发，结成双股大辫，高高盘在头上。那印度女人，这一次虽然是西式装束，依旧带着浓厚的东方色彩。玄色轻纱氅底下，她穿着金鱼黄紧身长衣，盖住了手，只露出晶亮的指甲。领口挖成极狭的Ｖ形，直开到腰际，那是巴黎最新的款式，有个名式，唤做""一线天""。她的脸色黄而油润，像飞了金的观音菩萨，然而她的影沉沉的大眼睛里躲着妖魔。古典型的直鼻子，只是太尖，太薄一点。粉红的厚重的小嘴唇，仿佛肿着似的。柳原站住了脚，向她微微鞠了一躬。流苏在那里看她，她也昂然望着流苏，那一双骄矜的眼睛，如同隔着几千里地，远远的向人望过来。柳原便介绍道：""这是白小姐。这是萨黑荑妮公主。""流苏不觉肃然起敬。萨黑荑妮伸出一只手来，用指尖碰了一碰流苏的手，问柳原道：""这位白小姐，也是上海来的？""柳原点点头。萨黑荑妮微笑道：""她倒不像上海人。""柳原笑道：""像哪儿的人呢？""萨黑荑妮把一只食指按在腮帮子上，想了一想，翘着十指尖尖，仿佛是要形容而又形容不出的样子，耸肩笑了一笑，往里走去。柳原扶着流苏继续往外走，流苏虽然听不大懂英文，鉴貌辨色，也就明白了，便笑道：""我原是个乡下人。""柳原道：""我刚才对你说过了，你是个道地的中国人，那自然跟她所谓的上海人有点不同。""

"书记和镇长既兴奋又紧张，立即召开全体职工会议，研究落实接待工作，最后形成的决议：一、书记镇长全程陪同。书记与大工厂基建负责人分工抓视察活动，镇长分工抓两个村子的调研活动。二、由书记向黄书记汇报樱镇党委镇政府工作，汇报材料由白仁宝起草。三、镇长抓安全保卫、控制上访人员工作。四、从今日起所有人员不得请假，不得关手机，坚守岗位，随时领取任务。

全体职工会议一结束，镇长还再开政府办公会议，确定下黄书记一行要去的村子是镇中街村和松云寺坡湾后的大石礁村。在镇中街村调研时，因镇中街村和镇东街村本是一个大自然村，所以两村提前清理垃圾，填平道路，打扫门庭。可以将已布置好镇东街村的党员活动室变为镇中街村的党员活动室，而突击布置出一间文化站来，至于医疗站不可能在短时间里建成，汇报时就说因为在镇街上，村民有病都去的是镇卫生院。在大石石童村访贫问苦，安排到王长计老汉家，王长计老汉会说话，又留有白胡子，和黄书记照相好看。给王长计老汉的新被子和三百元由综治办办理。在王长计责任田里劳动事宜，具体由马副镇长负责。照相一事由侯干事办，曹老八爱玩相机，让他也拍照，必须给他讲清遵守拍照纪律。镇长说完，问还有他没有考虑到的地方大家也都说说，集思广益。马副镇长就说：黄书记两小时上一次厕所，这就得把王长计老汉家的厕所收拾干净，三天之内所有人不得再去使用，而视察调研沿途也选择三个厕所收拾干净，并将所有能看到的尿窖子全棚盖上包谷秆和豆秆。还有黄书记要劳动，那就让黄书记拿锨扎地，大石礁村的田地多石渣，如果黄书记一锨没扎下去多尴尬，这就得提前把那块地翻一遍，疏软才是。随便用一把旧锨不雅观，起码得安个新锨把，但新锨把容易磨手，这就要王长计老汉安一个新锨把了，用瓷片刮光，用手磨蹭发亮才是。镇长说：到底是老同志，考虑得细致，就这样办。突然，他拍着脑袋说：差点就忘了！咱总得给黄书记送礼品吧，总不能还是核桃木耳蜂蜜土鸡蛋吧？带灯一直没说话，这阵说：当然送樱阳玉井莲刻字拓片最好，但驿址崖刻被炸了么。镇长说：不要说那些事。带灯也就不说了。白仁宝说：我有个主意，不知当讲不？镇长说：讲么。白仁宝说：让带灯贡献出一张画么。镇长就看带灯，带灯说：甭看我，我又不是画家。镇长说：镇政府可以出钱买么。带灯说：再出钱那没画呀！镇长说：那就不送了？县委县政府办公室还指示，能献歌献诗的最好，樱镇又没民间歌手也没农民诗人，咱没这条件就取消了吧。侯干事说：带灯主任文采好，让带灯主任做一首诗么。竹子训道：你少胡出主意，上边说是农民诗人，带灯主任就是能做诗她是农民吗，样子像农民吗？别到时你欺骗黄书记而让黄书记给你个吃不了兜着走？！镇长说：献诗的事就不说了。大家看还有什么事漏遗了？白仁宝说：安排吃饭问题，当然就安排在松云寺下的那个饭店了，那里有野味。要提醒的是那家老娘常年瘫在炕上，蓬头垢面的，若被黄书记他们看见影响不好，应在头一天接到邻居家去住。镇长说：对。还有，黄书记一行饭后休息怎么安排？马副镇长说：让饭店收拾出一间房子，提前拆洗一床被褥。带灯忍不住说：再拆洗也不能用他们的被褥，给黄书记惹上虱子了咋办？镇长说：这倒提醒了我，如果吃了饭就在饭店休息不妥，即便不用老炕，重新支床，备上新被褥、单子、枕头什么的，那环境就是那样，能保证不惹上虱子？还是吃了饭后回镇政府大院休息。白仁宝说：咱们把自己的床腾出来。也不敢说就没虱子呀！镇长说：这实在是个教训，看来镇政府将来得弄几间房的招待所了。你说咱们的床不敢说就没虱子，那黄书记怎么休息？白仁宝说：下午活动那么多，会不会黄书记就不休息？镇长说：县上特意叮咛了，黄书记有午休习惯，必须得休息。就又拿眼睛看带灯。带灯说：你看我干啥？安排黄书记在你或书记的房间休息了，他或许同情了基层干部的生存状况，能拨款给樱镇修些澡堂子，从此就没虱子了。马副镇长说：这个时候带灯你不要贫嘴。镇长却笑着说：带灯这么呛我，是她明白了我的意思。带灯说：我不明白。镇长说：只能是你和竹子腾出房间了。白仁宝说：啊就是，就是，让睡她们的床么，同行的可能都不会休息，那黄书记睡带灯，县委书记睡竹子。带灯说：把舌头放顺了说！白仁宝才意识到自己话说得不周全，忙更正：带灯和竹子的床上没虱子，腾出来让两个书记休息。带灯还要说什么，镇长说：你不要说，就这样定啦！大家再想想，还有什么没考虑到的？大家想了又想，再想不出，就说：没了。镇长说：如果没了，大家分头去干活，带灯和竹子留下，咱还要把控制上访者的事议议。竹子说：呀呀，多亏来的是个市委书记，若北京城里来了国家领导人，那咱们该怎么接待呀！镇长说：国家领导人来？你做梦去吧！黄书记也不是你想让他来他就能来的！","在这个秋高气爽的早晨，镇政府的会议室里弥漫着一股紧张的气氛，书记李伟和镇长张强正紧锣密鼓地筹备着接待市委黄书记的工作。这次视察，对于全镇来说，不仅仅是一次惯常的官场活动，更是展示镇子整体发展形象、争取更多资源支持的良机。会议桌上铺展开的几张地图和流程图，无不显露出他们的精心布置和周密策划。

""我们先来梳理一下整体安排，确保每一个环节都滴水不漏，""李伟书记率先打破了沉默。他一边看着手中的计划表，一边对在座的镇干部们说，""首先，我们要把接待黄书记的安全保卫工作落实到人，这点马虎不得。""总务科的李科长点了点头，表示会安排专门的安保团队，提前三天就开始进行预演和巡查。

镇长张强接过话头，说道：“环境整治方面，我们也不能掉以轻心，尤其是几个重点村庄，如林村和桥村，这两个地方是黄书记点名要去调研的。环保所的简主任，你这边要抓紧时间，重点清理街道、村巷的卫生死角，还要组织村民进行环境保护宣传，务必让村庄焕然一新。”

简主任翻开她的笔记本，在上面快速地记着，同时小声和同事讨论着清理方案。为了迎接这次视察，简主任和她的团队早已夜不能寐，想方设法要让黄书记能看到村庄最美好的一面。

接下来的会议重点转向了调研点的布置。镇里计划安排黄书记参观几个具有代表性的产业项目和扶贫示范点，包括新建成的蔬菜大棚、扶贫车间以及正在建设中的文化广场。“我们需要把这些调研点布置得既不失真实又能展现实力，既要有面子工程，但更要有里子工作的实质内容。”李伟书记的这番话，让大家都清楚了重点。

为了更好地展示调研点的成果，镇政府还特别制作了一份详尽的PPT，包括每个项目的立项背景、进展情况、未来规划等内容，务求让黄书记在短时间内能全面了解各个项目的情况。负责这份PPT制作的青年干部小王，连续几个晚上加班到深夜，只为每一个数据和图片的准确无误。

当然，谈到接待工作，也少不了礼品和午休方案的安排。这一部分由办公室的王秘书负责。镇政府精心挑选了一些本地特色的礼品，如手工制作的红薯粉条、农家自制的咸蛋黄、还有一些工艺精美的地方名品，既有心意又符合规矩。中午的午休则安排在镇政府旁边新建的小型休闲公园，这里幽静雅致，有几间供官员短暂休息的小木屋，还备有茶点和水果。

王秘书详细汇报了礼品清单和午休方案，他说：“这些礼品都是我们精选甄选的，每一件都代表着我们镇的特色和对黄书记的敬意。而关于午休，我们也是考虑到黄书记劳累，一定要安排一个舒适的环境。”

整个会议过程持续了将近两个小时，每个人都从自己的分工出发，汇报了当前的进展和存在的问题，确保对每个细节都考虑得周全。李伟书记和镇长张强不时互相交换意见，考虑到了方方面面的问题，相信在各方面通力合作下，这次接待工作一定能圆满顺利地完成。

会议结束后，李伟书记重新对所有人进行了动员，他庄重地说道：“大家辛苦了，这次接待任务对我们的意义非凡，绝不容许有半点纰漏。希望大家回去后能继续保持高度的工作状态，共同打赢这场硬仗。”

散会后，大家陆陆续续离开会议室，回到各自的岗位继续紧张的工作。简主任提着大包小包的清洁工具，直奔下一个待整治的村庄。小王则坐在电脑前，继续琢磨着PPT的细节。而王秘书已经在安排如何将礼品精美地打包，以免在送礼时发生任何意外。

在这些紧张而有序的准备工作中，每个人都发挥着自己的光和热，为接待黄书记视察贡献着自己的力量。早在几个星期前，镇里的每个部门都已经进入了备战状态，为这次视察提前筹备。每个细节都在精雕细琢，只为在黄书记面前展现出最佳的一面。

时间一天天临近，黄书记视察的日子终于到来了。这一天，清晨的阳光洒在整洁的街道上，村民们也纷纷换上了崭新的衣服，脸上洋溢着自豪和期待。李伟书记和张强镇长站在镇政府大门前，亲自迎接黄书记的到来。

黄书记在一群人的簇拥下走下车来，面带微笑，和每一个迎接他的人握手问好。参观开始了，黄书记先后走访了新建成的蔬菜大棚、扶贫车间和文化广场，每到一处，都详细询问项目的进展和遇到的困难。李伟书记和张强镇长陪同在旁，耐心地解答，强调镇政府在推动这些项目过程中费心费力的每一个细节。

参观过程中，黄书记不时点头表示赞许，他对村庄的环境整治成果、项目的实际效益以及镇政府团队的努力给予了高度评价。“你们的工作非常出色，展示出了基层政府的担当和创新。这些项目不仅提升了经济效益，更是改善了百姓的生活质量。”黄书记的肯定，让在场的每一个镇干部心中都涌起一股骄傲和自豪感。

午休时间，黄书记在新建的小型休闲公园里短暂休息。浓密的树荫下，清风徐来，他闭目养神，仿佛感受到这片土地的宁静和美好。这时，王秘书轻轻走上前来，呈上镇里准备的特色礼品，并简要介绍了每一件礼品的含义和制作过程。黄书记点头微笑，表示非常满意。

整个视察过程顺利而圆满，镇政府的每一个细节安排都得到了黄书记的肯定。在送别黄书记的那一刻，李伟书记和张强镇长心里都松了一口气，但更多的是对未来的坚定信心和满怀期待。他们深知，这次视察成功只是一个开始，未来还有更多的挑战和机遇等待他们去迎接和把握。

夕阳西下，黄书记的车队渐行渐远，而镇里的各项工作也逐步恢复了正常。在这片土地上，每一个日出日落，都在记录着人们为建设美好家园所付出的努力和汗水。尽管前路漫长，他们依然心怀信念，肩负使命，勇敢前行。",易,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,书记和镇长筹备接待市委黄书记，召开全体职工会议和政府办公会议，分配具体接待和调研任务，重点关注安全保卫、村庄环境整治、调研点布置等细节。为黄书记准备礼品和午休方案，安排调研村庄及活动，确保黄书记的视察顺利进行。,1903

"聪明的牲口确乎知道人意，刚刚望见宅门，那马便立刻放缓脚步了，并且和它背上的主人同时垂了头，一步一顿，像捣米一样。

暮霭笼罩了大宅，邻屋上都腾起浓黑的炊烟，已经是晚饭时候。家将们听得马蹄声，早已迎了出来，都在宅门外垂着手直挺挺地站着。羿（2）在垃圾堆边懒懒地下了马，家将们便接过缰绳和鞭子去。他刚要跨进大门，低头看看挂在腰间的满壶的簇新的箭和网里的三匹乌老鸦和一匹射碎了的小麻雀，心里就非常踌蹰。但到底硬着头皮，大踏步走进去了；箭在壶里豁朗豁朗地响着。

刚到内院，他便见嫦娥（3）在圆窗里探了一探头。他知道她眼睛快，一定早瞧见那几匹乌鸦的了，不觉一吓，脚步登时也一停，——但只得往里走。使女们都迎出来，给他卸了弓箭，解下网兜。他仿佛觉得她们都在苦笑。

“太太……。”他擦过手脸，走进内房去，一面叫。

嫦娥正在看着圆窗外的暮天，慢慢回过头来，似理不理的向他看了一眼，没有答应。

这种情形，羿倒久已习惯的了，至少已有一年多。他仍旧走近去，坐在对面的铺着脱毛的旧豹皮的木榻上，搔着头皮，支支梧梧地说——

“今天的运气仍旧不见佳，还是只有乌鸦……。”

“哼！”嫦娥将柳眉一扬，忽然站起来，风似的往外走，嘴里咕噜着，“又是乌鸦的炸酱面，又是乌鸦的炸酱面！你去问问去，谁家是一年到头只吃乌鸦肉的炸酱面的？我真不知道是走了什么运，竟嫁到这里来，整年的就吃乌鸦的炸酱面！”

“太太，”羿赶紧也站起，跟在后面，低声说，“不过今天倒还好，另外还射了一匹麻雀，可以给你做菜的。女辛（4）！”他大声地叫使女，“你把那一匹麻雀拿过来请太太看！”

野味已经拿到厨房里去了，女辛便跑去挑出来，两手捧着，送在嫦娥的眼前。

“哼！”她瞥了一眼，慢慢地伸手一捏，不高兴地说，“一团糟！不是全都粉碎了么？肉在那里？”

“是的，”羿很惶恐，“射碎的。我的弓太强，箭头太大了。”

“你不能用小一点的箭头的么？”

“我没有小的。自从我射封豕长蛇（5）……。”","夜幕初降，沉甸甸的暮色渐渐压下，猎场的空气里充斥着刺鼻的湿气和泥土的芬芳。羿拖着疲惫的身子，心中无比懊恼。他手中提着几个灰黑的猎物，风尘仆仆地朝自己的宅邸走去。家将早早守在大门处，望见他回来，立刻迎了上来。

“老爷回来了，今天如何？”家将满脸堆笑，眼中却流露出一丝担忧。

“还不是老样子。”羿叹了口气，将手中的猎物递给他。几只瘦小的乌鸦，一只已经被摔得支离破碎的麻雀，这就是他今天的收获。

院中的家仆闻声也赶了过来，有人小心翼翼地接过羿手上的猎物，有人忙着烧水准备清洗。人群中，嫦娥的身影袅袅地移了出来，她的脸上写满了不悦与疲倦。

“又是乌鸦吗？”嫦娥两手搭在腰间，眉宇之间透着浓浓的失望。“我们已经吃了几个月的乌鸦了，味道早就腻了。”

羿知道，她抱怨的不仅仅是乌鸦的滋味。连日来的糟糕狩猎已经磨损了她的耐心，甚至动摇了她对夫君的信心。

“这是猎场的情况所致，有时运气不好。”羿试图解释，却发现自己的声音有些无力。

嫦娥没有轻易放过：“运气不好？你看看这只麻雀，连个整的都没有。你到底用的是什么箭头？？”她的眼神中充满了质疑。

羿心中一沉，不由一阵心烦意乱。他紧握拳头，手心已渗出冷汗，这些年来狩猎的技艺似乎在衰退，他也不愿多想其中缘由。

“这是我尽力而为的结果。”他强压住心中的烦躁，把那几只乌鸦递到她眼前，“再不济，这也是我们的食物，总比饿着强。”

嫦娥不再说话，转身留下一句：“随你。”

羿望着她离去的背影，心中如坠千斤。狩猎的挫败、妻子的失望，这一切都像利箭一样刺痛着他的自尊。满目寂静的宅邸，似乎在无声地嘲笑他的无能。

夜色更浓，庭院中的灯火忽明忽暗。羿意识到，这不是一场简单的狩猎失败，而是他与嫦娥之间的深伏暗涌。院中传来轻微的风声，仿佛在叹息着这对夫妻的间隙。

羿无奈地转身，看着夜空中的云层，心中默默发誓，下一次，他一定要带回让嫦娥满意的猎物，恢复他们曾经的和谐美好。",易,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字描述了羿在猎场归来后，因猎物不佳而与妻子嫦娥发生矛盾。羿家的家将迎接他回宅，他展示了自己的战利品——几匹乌鸦和一只碎成糟的麻雀，引起嫦娥的不满。嫦娥抱怨长期食用乌鸦肉感到厌倦和不满，甚至对羿的猎物质量提出了质疑，指出羿无法使用合适的箭头狩猎。,789

"有庆念了两年书，到了十岁光景，家里日子算是好过一些了，那时凤霞也跟看我们一起下地干活，凤霞已经能自己养活自己了。家里还养了两头羊，全靠有庆割草去喂它们。每天蒙蒙亮时，家珍就把有庆叫醒，这孩子把镰刀扔在篮子里，一只手提着，一只手搓着眼睛跌跌冲冲走出屋门去割草，那样子怪可怜的，孩子在这个年纪是最睡不醒的，可有什么办法呢？没有有庆去割草，两头羊就得饿死。到了有庆提着一篮草回来，上学也快迟到了，急忙往嘴里塞一碗饭，边嚼边往城里跑。中午跑回家又得割草，喂了羊再自己吃饭，上学自然又来不及了。有庆十来岁的时候，一天两次来去就得跑五十多里路。

有庆这么跑，鞋当然坏得快。家珍是城里有钱人家出生，觉得有庆是上学的孩子了，不能再光着脚丫，给他做了一双布鞋。我倒觉得上学只要把书念好就行，穿不穿鞋有什么关系。有庆穿上新鞋才两个月，我看到家珍又在纳鞋底，问她是给谁做鞋，她说是给有庆。

田里的活已经把家珍累得说话都没力气了，有庆非得把他娘累死。我把有庆穿了两个月的鞋拿起来一看，这哪还是鞋，鞋底磨穿了不说，一只鞋连鞋帮都掉了。等有庆提着满满一篮草回来时，我把鞋扔过去，揪住他的耳朵让他看看：

“你这是穿的，还是啃的？”

有庆摸着被揪疼的耳朵，咧了咧嘴，想哭又不敢哭。我警告他：

“你再这样穿鞋，我就把你的脚砍掉。”

其实是我没道理，家里的两头羊全靠有庆喂它们，这孩子在家干这么重的活，耽误了上学时间总是跑着去，中午放学想早点回来割草，又跑着回来。不说羊粪肥田这事，就是每年剪了羊毛去卖了的钱，也不知道能给有庆做多少双鞋。我这么一说以后，有庆上学就光脚丫跑去，到了学校再穿上鞋。

有一次都下雪了，他还是光着脚丫在雪地里吧哒吧哒往学校跑，让我这个做爹的看得好心疼，我叫住他：

“你手里拿着什么？”

这孩子站在雪地里看着手里的鞋，可能是糊涂了，都不知道说什么。我说：

“那是鞋，不是手套，你给我穿上。”

他这才穿上了鞋，缩着脑袋等我下面的话，我向他挥挥手：

“你走吧。”

有庆转身往城里跑，跑了没多远，我看到他又脱下了鞋。","有庆是家里最小的孩子，今年刚满十岁，小小年纪的他已经承担起了不少家务。每天清晨，当黎明的第一缕阳光还未穿透雾气，有庆便起床了。他小心翼翼地走过家里的土地，忍住寒冷，快速穿上母亲做的布鞋，然后匆匆开始一天的工作。村子里的一切似乎都还在沉睡，只有他和几只早起的鸡在晨曦中活动着。

有庆家的院子不大，两个木棚中分别养着家里仅有的两头羊。这两头羊是家里的宝贝，为了给它们准备足够的饲料，有庆必须每天都去田里割草。这份工作看似简单，但真正做起来却很辛苦。田里的草长得高，深一脚浅一脚地踏进去，没一会儿鞋子就会湿透。不论天气如何，有庆每天都要往返于田地与家之间，腰间挂着割草的镰刀，小手因为长期握着镰刀而长满了老茧。

有庆的母亲家珍是个勤劳且善良的农妇，看到儿子每天奔波劳累，她的心里总是充满了愧疚与不安。家珍常常在夜里拿出针线，把白天坏掉的鞋子一针一线地缝补，很多次，她都因为心疼儿子的劳累而泪湿眼眶。尽管她做的布鞋质量很好，但是再好的布鞋也经不起长时间的磨损。不出几天，有庆的鞋子就会磨破几个洞。

对此，有庆的父亲老刘心情复杂。家里条件艰苦，鞋子对于他们来说实在是珍贵。有次看到有庆每天穿坏两双鞋子，老刘心里的怒火再也忍不住了。他狠狠地揪住有庆的耳朵责骂道：“你这臭小子，鞋子不要钱吗！天天！天天穿坏！你让咱家怎么活！”

那天晚上，有庆哭湿了枕头，但他不怪父亲，他能理解父亲面对生活重压的无奈和痛苦。次日清晨，他像往常一样早早起床，偷偷摸地穿上那双已经打了几个补丁的布鞋，忍着疼痛，继续走向田野。冬天的早晨，寒风凛冽，地面上铺满了薄薄的霜，有庆在这冰冷的晨曦中小跑着，用温暖的双手脚感受着大地的触感。

有一天，老刘因为生病在家休息，正好看到有庆光着脚，健步如飞地跑向学校。那一刻，老刘的心像是被什么东西狠狠地扎了一下。虽然父子两没有言语上的交流，但眼神中却透着复杂的情感，那是一种刺痛与自责交织的情感。所以，后来每当老刘看到有庆磨破的鞋子，虽仍会心疼，但更多的是深深的怜惜，他开始默默地支持与理解有庆的辛苦与数据。

有庆这个小男孩，在贫困和重担中逐渐成长。他开始学会利用课余时间打点小工，为家里稍微补贴一些生活费用。他没有多余的时间玩耍，但却对知识渴望无比，课堂上总是认真听讲，笔记密密麻麻。乡村的生活虽然艰苦，但有庆用他稚嫩的肩膀扛起了一份份责任，用他的韧劲和勤奋为家庭带来一丝温暖和希望。

尽管生活的重担总是压在这个小小的家庭上，但在有庆和父母的共同努力下，总能在苦涩中寻找到一丝甜美。这段平凡且真实的农村生活，成为他们生命中最宝贵的回忆，也勾画了我们那个时代最质朴而温暖的画面。",易,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字描写了一位叫有庆的小男孩，他在十岁时每天需要割草喂养两头羊，还要去上学。因长期跑来跑去，他的鞋容易坏。有庆的母亲家珍不忍心孩子光脚，做了布鞋给他穿，但鞋子还是很快磨破。有庆的父亲曾因心疼鞋子揪过他的耳朵，但后来看到孩子冬天光脚跑着去学校，也感到心疼。这段描写反映了农村家庭的贫困和孩子承担的过重劳动。,863

"这一年夏天的时候，许三观从街上回到家里，对许玉兰说：

“我这一路走过来，没看到几户人家屋里有人，全到街上去了、我这辈子没见过街上有这么多人，胳膊上都套着个红袖章，游行的、刷标语的．贴大字报的，大街的墙上全是大字报，一张一张往上贴，越贴越厚，那些墙壁都像是穿上棉袄了。我还见到了县长，那个大胖子山东人，从前可是城里最神气的人，我从前见到他时，他手里都端着一个茶杯，如今他手里提着个破脸盆，边敲边骂自己，骂自己的头是狗头，骂自己的腿是狗腿……”

许三观说：“你知道吗？为什么工厂停工了、商店关门了、学校不上课、你也用不着去炸抽条了？为什么有人被吊在了树上、有人被关进了牛棚、有人被活活打死？你知道吗？为什么毛主席一说话，就有人把他的话编成了歌，就有人把他的话刷到了墙上、刷到了地上、刷到了汽车上和轮船上、床单上和枕巾上、杯子上和锅上，连厕所的墙上和痰盂上都有。毛主席的名字为什么会这么长予你听着：伟大的领袖伟大的导师伟大的统帅伟大的舵手毛主席万岁万岁万万岁。一共有三十个字，这些都要一口气念下来，中间不能换气。你知道这是为什么？因为文化大革命来了

许三观说：”文化大革命闹到今天，我有点明白过来了，什么叫文化革命？其实就是一个报私分的时候，以前谁要是得罪了你，你就写一张大字报，贴到街上去，说他是漏网地主也好，说他是反革命也好，年月最多的就是罪名，随便拿一个过来，写到大字报上，再贴出去，就用不着你自己动手了，别人会把他在死里整……这些日子，我躺在床上左思右想，是不是找个仇人出亲，写他一张大字报，报一下旧仇。我想来想去，竟然想不出一个仇人来，只有何小勇能算半个仇人，可那个王八蛋何小勇四年前就让卡车给撞死了。我许三观为人善良，几十年如一日，没有一个仇人，这也好，我没有仇人，就不会有人来贴我的大字报。“

许三观话音未落，三乐推门进来，对他们说：”有人在米店墙上贴了一张大字报，说妈是破鞋

……“

许三观和许玉兰吓了一跳，立刻跑到米店那里，往墙上的大字报一看，三乐没有说错，在很多大字报里、有一张就是写许玉兰的，说许玉兰是破鞋，是烂货，说许玉兰十五岁就做了妓女，出两元钱就可以和她睡觉，说许玉兰睡过的男人十辆卡车都装不下。

许玉兰伸手指着那张大字报，破口大骂起来：”你妈才是破鞋，你妈才是烂货，你妈才是妓女，你妈睡过的男人，别说是十辆卡车，就是地球都装不下。“

然后，许玉兰转过身来，对着许三观哭了起来，她哭着说：”只有断子绝孙的人，只有头上长疮、脚底流脓的人，才会这么血口喷人……“

山西人还爱吃酸菜，雁北尤甚。什么都拿来酸，除了萝卜白菜，还包括杨树叶子，榆树钱儿。有人来给姑娘说亲，当妈的先问，那家有几口酸菜缸。酸菜缸多，说明家底子厚。

辽宁人爱吃酸菜白肉火锅。

北方人不是不爱吃甜，只是过去糖难得。我家曾有老保姆，正定乡下人，六十多岁了。她还有个婆婆，八十几了。她有一次要回乡探亲，临行称了两斤白糖，说她的婆婆就爱喝个白糖水。

北京人很保守，过去不知苦瓜为何物，近年有人学会吃了。菜农也有种的了。农贸市场上有很好的苦瓜卖，属于“细菜”，价颇昂。

北京人在口味上开放了！

北京人过去就知道吃大白菜。由此可见，大白菜主义是可以被打倒的。

北方人初春吃苣荬菜。苣荬菜分甜荬、苦荬，苦荬相当的苦。

剧团有一干部，是写字幕的，有时也管杂务。此人是个吃辣的专家。他每天中午饭不吃菜，吃辣椒下饭。全国各地的，少数民族的，各种辣椒，他都千方百计地弄来吃，剧团到上海演出，他帮助搞伙食，这下好，不会缺辣椒吃。原以为上海辣椒不好买，他下车第二天就找到一家专卖各种辣椒的铺子。上海人有一些是能吃辣的。",在中国，饮食文化因地域差异呈现出丰富多彩的面貌，展现了各地人民对食物独特的理解和喜好。山西人对醋的热爱可谓众所周知，无论是用来调味还是直接食用，醋在山西人的餐桌上占据着重要的位置。酸菜更是山西饮食文化中的一大特色，走入山西人的家中，你几乎不可能错过那坛酸菜的醇香味。这种发酵食品不仅能增加食物的风味，还被认为有助于消化，深得人心。北上的辽宁，酸菜的影子同样无处不在，与其共舞的是肥美的白肉，二者在热气腾腾的火锅中相遇，碰撞出独特的美味，成为辽东地区冬季餐桌上一道不可或缺的美食。北京，这座兼具古典与现代气息的城市，其饮食习惯也在不断演变。传统的羊肉酸菜汤和杂面是北京人经久不衰的美食选择。而近年来，北京人的饮食习惯也在悄然发生变化，各种来自全国甚至世界各地的美食在这里扎根发芽，丰富了北京人的餐桌。南下福建和广西，酸笋则成了当地人的心头好。酸笋的酸爽与脆嫩，与各种食材搭配起来，能演绎出无数道令人垂涎欲滴的菜肴。在东南亚文化影响深远的广西，酸笋炖鸡更是家常便饭。傣族人的酸笋炖鸡，味道鲜美，酸香扑鼻，让人忍不住一口接一口。在延庆的山里，随着夏季的到来，一种名为“酸饭”的美食也登上了餐桌。酸饭以其独特的酸味和清爽的口感，缓解了夏日的酷热，成为当地人夏天消暑的一道佳肴。而在江南的无锡和广东，甜食文化则主导了人们的饮食偏好。无锡人对甜食的热爱仿佛已经深入骨髓，从甜甜的无锡排骨到各种糖水甜点，小吃甜品层出不穷。而广东，则以其丰富多样的甜品而闻名，糖水铺、一盅两件、鸡蛋仔，都是广东甜品文化的代表。同样，北京人的饮食习惯也历经沧桑。传统京味小吃如豌豆黄、驴打滚、豆汁等，依然是老北京人心中的珍馐。然而，时光流转，新一代的北京人开始接受并喜好各国各地的美食，餐桌上的选择愈发丰富多样。随着春天的到来，苣荬菜成为了北方人餐桌上的常客。这种野菜带有一丝苦味，却也是北方人心中的春之味。将苣荬菜焯水后凉拌或炒食，都能保留其特有的清香和脆嫩口感，在春日里别有一番清新滋味。贵州则以其独特的鱼腥草而著名。鱼腥草虽名字怪异，味道却是一种独特的存在。有些人对它爱之深沉，有些人则敬而远之。其特有的腥味和微苦的口感，在贵州人的烹饪舞台上屡屡出现。最后，不得不提到某剧团里的那位干部。他对辣椒的喜爱，即使身居北方也丝毫不减。他总是随身携带一小袋自制的辣椒，一日三餐，辣味不离口。这种对辣椒的执着令人不禁感叹每个人对饮食的热爱与执念，也是对生活的独特诠释。中国各地丰富多彩的饮食文化，不仅仅是一份美味的菜单，更是一幅描绘人们生活方式和态度的动人画卷。,易,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字描述了中国各地人们的饮食习惯和口味偏好。其中，山西人喜欢吃醋和酸菜，辽宁人喜欢吃酸菜白肉火锅，北京人喜欢羊肉酸菜汤和杂面，福建人和广西人喜欢吃酸笋，傣族人喜欢酸笋炖鸡，延庆山里夏天吃酸饭等。文章还讲述了无锡和广东的甜食文化，北京人饮食习惯的变化，以及北方人春天吃苣荬菜等。另外，还提到贵州人吃鱼腥草和剧团里一个干部吃辣椒的习惯。,1018
"山西人真能吃醋！几个山西人在北京下饭馆，坐定之后，还没有点菜，先把醋瓶子拿过来，每人喝了三调羹醋。邻座的客人直瞪眼。有一年我到太原去，快过春节了。别处过春节，都供应一点好酒，太原的油盐店却都贴出一个条子：“供应老陈醋，每户一斤。”这在山西人是大事。

山西人还爱吃酸菜，雁北尤甚。什么都拿来酸，除了萝卜白菜，还包括杨树叶子，榆树钱儿。有人来给姑娘说亲，当妈的先问，那家有几口酸菜缸。酸菜缸多，说明家底子厚。

辽宁人爱吃酸菜白肉火锅。

都说苏州菜甜，其实苏州菜只是淡，真正甜的是无锡。无锡炒鳝糊放那么多糖！包子的肉馅里也放很多糖，没法吃！

四川夹沙肉用大片肥猪肉夹了洗沙蒸，广西芋头扣肉用大片肥猪肉夹芋泥蒸，都极甜，很好吃，但我最多只能吃两片。

广东人爱吃甜食。昆明金碧路有一家广东人开的甜品店，卖芝麻糊、绿豆沙，广东同学趋之若鹜。“番薯糖水”即用白薯切块熬的汤，这有什么好喝的呢？广东同学曰：“好！”

北方人不是不爱吃甜，只是过去糖难得。我家曾有老保姆，正定乡下人，六十多岁了。她还有个婆婆，八十几了。她有一次要回乡探亲，临行称了两斤白糖，说她的婆婆就爱喝个白糖水。

北京人很保守，过去不知苦瓜为何物，近年有人学会吃了。菜农也有种的了。农贸市场上有很好的苦瓜卖，属于“细菜”，价颇昂。

"Even as the two creatures leaped down to the floor, and before they could change their low cries of astonishment into louder cries of alarm, Marlin and I had leaped across the compartment toward them! For a full two-score feet in one great leap we shot toward them, a feat only possible with Triton's lesser gravitation, and only possible, too, because we knew in that moment that a single loud cry from the two creatures would bring to their aid the hundreds of Neptunians sleeping about us. Before either could utter such a cry, we two had shot through the air and were upon them!
So astounded were they with our appearance and our supernatural leap across the compartment, that before they could put themselves into a posture of defense, we had struck them, had knocked them to the floor and were grappling with them. In that first moment of contact I had reached for the mouth-opening of the disk-bodied monster at whom I had leaped, had gripped that opening in the top of its disk-body to prevent its outcry and then had striven to lift the thing sidewise, to hurl it against the floor. But great as was my strength against Triton's lesser gravitation, the strength of the Neptunian I held was greater still, and its weight, due to the weight-disks worn by it, was enormous. In an instant its seven great limbs were clutching for me, grasping me, and as I strained there against that great monstrous disk-body's grip, I knew with fatal certainty that never could I match my strength against its own. For even as I struggled desperately with it, Marlin struggling as wildly with the other beside me, the thing was lifting me with its own great limbs from the floor!
Upward it drew me with those powerful limbs, its bulging glassy eyes staring from its disk-body's edge straight into my own, as we grappled desperately in the dark compartment with the sleeping Neptunians all about us! I felt myself being overcome, my strength puny beside the strength of that monster, and as I clutched wildly still at the mouth-opening in the top of the disk-body, I thrust my clenched fist down into that small round mouth-opening, half by chance and half by design, closing it thus with my balled fist. Instantly the creature's body turned and twisted frantically, its grip upon me forgotten for the moment, its whole body's mass seeming to heave and twitch as my hand thus cut off the passage of air into that mouth-opening, into its body! I was throttling it, I knew, and hung fiercely to my grip upon it, my clenched hand still within its mouth-opening, while the thing swayed and tore at me with ever-decreasing strength. A moment more and its struggles ceased, it collapsed limply to the floor, and I staggered up again to my feet.
In a single glance I saw that the other Neptunian had gripped Marlin and was crushing him against a corner of the compartment's shelving and instantly, with a single great leap, I was upon that other monster, had gained upon it the same throttling grip which I had found was so deadly to these creatures. In a flash the Neptunian had released his hold upon Marlin, was whirling me around the compartment, shaking me this way and that, and wildly attempting to tear itself loose from me, but with the last of my strength I hung to it, and in a few moments it, too, had weakened, then had slumped down in a lifeless, grotesque mass. And as I rose from it I saw that Marlin had staggered up likewise, was coming toward me. None other of the Neptunians had been aroused by the noise of our mad combat, because in the first excitement of that combat the two Neptunians we fought had not thought to cry out, and after I had gained that throttling hold upon them they could not. So around us the silent ranks of Neptunians slept on unaroused, their open, glassy eyes full upon us even in their sleep, while Marlin and I were stumbling toward the compartment's door.
""On, Hunt!"" he whispered hoarsely. ""We still have a chance, if we can find a landing-compartment, can steal one of the cylinders before these sleeping Neptunians wake!""
Through the next compartment we went, and the next, and the next, all sleep-compartments, filled with rows of slumbering Neptunians like those behind us, but in our progress we had come upon no landing-compartment. And though we knew that such there were here and there on Triton's dark side, we could not tell, in the darkness and with the huge walls towering all around us, in what direction from us they might be. We could but blunder aimlessly on through the maze of adjoining sleep-compartments in the blind hope that we might chance upon one of the landing-sections, and as we went on, staggering in great, irregular leaps through compartment after compartment, all filled either with masses of sleeping Neptunians or with great heat-radiating mechanisms, we knew that at any moment might come the great signal of light that would awaken the hordes around us.
Never could there have been flight more nightmare-like than that of Marlin and myself through the dark compartments of Triton's dark side, in blind search for the cylinders which alone held out to us any chance of escape. Through the sleep-compartments, with their masses of open-eyed and sleeping disk-bodied Neptunians, through the compartments where reared the great glowing globes whose radiated heat alone held back the cold doom that so long had threatened these strange beings, through compartment after compartment in a flight made more grotesque and unreal to us by the strange method of our progress; by the strange, great, smooth leaps that we made instead of steps, great floating leaps of a score of feet in which we rushed through the dark sleeping compartments, reckless now of the few Neptunians who might be waking and moving upon the dark side. Then suddenly as we leaped toward the door of still another sleep-compartment, poised an instant to leap through that low door, we halted, gazed with abruptly-flaring hope ahead. For the next compartment, we saw, was a rectangular one and greater in size than any we had passed through as yet, and in it there stood the great gleaming shapes of a score or more of the cylinder-fliers that we sought!
With hearts pounding Marlin and I crouched in the low door, gazing through the darkness toward those great cylinders, that gleamed a little in the feeble light that came down upon Triton's dark side from the stars through the great roof overhead. We saw that the low doors in the sides of those cylinders, near the bases, were open, and from them there came to us the throbbing of their mechanisms, inside! It was evident that these were part of the countless cylinders used to help in transporting the Neptunian hordes from dark side to sunward side of Triton, and vice versa, and it was equally evident from those throbbing mechanisms' operation, that the hour of awakening for those hordes was at hand and that these were waiting for that awakening. For there stood also, between us and the nearest of the cylinders, three tube-armed Neptunians who were conversing in brief, snapping speech as they waited!","中国的饮食文化丰富多样，因地域差异和气候条件，不同地方的人们形成了独特的饮食习惯和口味偏好。山西是一个典型的例子，这里的人民喜欢食用醋和酸菜。醋在山西的生活中不仅仅是一种调味料，更是不可或缺的日常用品。无论是小店里的山西刀削面，还是家庭厨房中的酌食，醋的身影总是随处可见。在寒冷的季节，一碗热气腾腾的酸菜汤是山西人驱寒御冷的佳品。酸菜是北方人家家户户都会腌制的一种食品，尤其是在长冬将尽，立春未到的时节，酸菜更是成为了山西餐桌上的常客。 

 辽宁人的饮食文化同样离不开酸菜，但与山西不同的是，辽宁人更喜欢将酸菜与白肉一同炖煮成火锅。这道“酸菜白肉火锅”是冬季里的一道家常美味。鲜香的酸菜搭配肥厚的猪肉，在滚烫的火锅中慢慢煮沸，散发出扑鼻的香气。寒冷的东北冬天，吃上一顿这样的火锅，浑身都洋溢着温暖。 

 在北京，这里的人们对饮食的偏好则更加多元。北京人喜欢羊肉酸菜汤，这道菜既有北方羊肉的滋补，又有酸菜的爽脆，两者相辅相成，成就了一道令人大快朵颐的佳肴。此外，北京的杂面也是一大特色，这种由多种粗粮混合制成的杂面不仅口感丰富，还因为富含膳食纤维而备受欢迎。北京人随着时代变化，对于食物的选择也在不断调整，但一些经典的传统美味依然流传下来。 

 南方的福建与广西，则以喜欢吃酸笋闻名。酸笋既可以生食，也能够用来炒菜或做汤。特别在广西地区，酸笋是许多地方特色美食的重要配料。在傣族地区，酸笋炖鸡是一道广受喜爱的传统菜肴。酸笋的酸爽滋味与鸡肉的香嫩口感融合在一起，形成了独具特色的美味体验。 

 无锡和广东则是以甜食文化出名。无锡的小笼包和汤圆，广东的双皮奶和陈皮糖水，这些令人垂涎欲滴的甜食不仅种类繁多，而且制作精细，口感独特。两地的甜点在中国饮食文化中占据着一席之地，充分体现了人们对于美食的追求。 

 延庆山区的人们在夏天有吃酸饭的传统。酸饭常由发酵的米饭制成，具有保鲜和消暑的作用。这种独特的食物不仅是当地的传统风味，也是夏季大家餐桌上的一道普通菜肴。 

 在北方，春天时节苣荬菜则是餐桌上的常见素食。苣荬菜具有独特的清香和微苦的口感，既能凉拌又能热炒，是春季补充营养的上佳选择。 

 贵州地区的人们习惯于吃鱼腥草，这种食材因其特殊的腥气和丰富的营养成分，成为贵州人餐桌上的常客。尤其是在春天，鱼腥草更是备受追捧的时令美味。 

 在剧团的日常生活中，有一位干部特别喜欢吃辣椒，这种习惯也能看出辣椒在中国饮食文化中的重要地位。无论是嗜辣的贵州人民，还是喜欢麻辣口感的川渝人，都展示了中国人对于不同口味的多样追求。每一种饮食习惯的形成，背后都有着复杂的地理、历史和文化因素，构成了中国丰富多彩的饮食文化画卷。",易,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"Marlin and Hunt find themselves in a desperate situation on Triton as they encounter Neptunian creatures.

In a single glance I saw that the other Neptunian had gripped Marlin and was crushing him against a corner of the compartment's shelving and instantly, with a single great leap, I was upon that other monster, had gained upon it the same throttling grip which I had found was so deadly to these creatures. In a flash the Neptunian had released his hold upon Marlin, was whirling me around the compartment, shaking me this way and that, and wildly attempting to tear itself loose from me, but with the last of my strength I hung to it, and in a few moments it, too, had weakened, then had slumped down in a lifeless, grotesque mass. And as I rose from it I saw that Marlin had staggered up likewise, was coming toward me. None other of the Neptunians had been aroused by the noise of our mad combat, because in the first excitement of that combat the two Neptunians we fought had not thought to cry out, and after I had gained that throttling hold upon them they could not. So around us the silent ranks of Neptunians slept on unaroused, their open, glassy eyes full upon us even in their sleep, while Marlin and I were stumbling toward the compartment's door.
""On, Hunt!"" he whispered hoarsely. ""We still have a chance, if we can find a landing-compartment, can steal one of the cylinders before these sleeping Neptunians wake!""
Through the next compartment we went, and the next, and the next, all sleep-compartments, filled with rows of slumbering Neptunians like those behind us, but in our progress we had come upon no landing-compartment. And though we knew that such there were here and there on Triton's dark side, we could not tell, in the darkness and with the huge walls towering all around us, in what direction from us they might be. We could but blunder aimlessly on through the maze of adjoining sleep-compartments in the blind hope that we might chance upon one of the landing-sections, and as we went on, staggering in great, irregular leaps through compartment after compartment, all filled either with masses of sleeping Neptunians or with great heat-radiating mechanisms, we knew that at any moment might come the great signal of light that would awaken the hordes around us.
Never could there have been flight more nightmare-like than that of Marlin and myself through the dark compartments of Triton's dark side, in blind search for the cylinders which alone held out to us any chance of escape. Through the sleep-compartments, with their masses of open-eyed and sleeping disk-bodied Neptunians, through the compartments where reared the great glowing globes whose radiated heat alone held back the cold doom that so long had threatened these strange beings, through compartment after compartment in a flight made more grotesque and unreal to us by the strange method of our progress; by the strange, great, smooth leaps that we made instead of steps, great floating leaps of a score of feet in which we rushed through the dark sleeping compartments, reckless now of the few Neptunians who might be waking and moving upon the dark side. Then suddenly as we leaped toward the door of still another sleep-compartment, poised an instant to leap through that low door, we halted, gazed with abruptly-flaring hope ahead. For the next compartment, we saw, was a rectangular one and greater in size than any we had passed through as yet, and in it there stood the great gleaming shapes of a score or more of the cylinder-fliers that we sought!
With hearts pounding Marlin and I crouched in the low door, gazing through the darkness toward those great cylinders, that gleamed a little in the feeble light that came down upon Triton's dark side from the stars through the great roof overhead. We saw that the low doors in the sides of those cylinders, near the bases, were open, and from them there came to us the throbbing of their mechanisms, inside! It was evident that these were part of the countless cylinders used to help in transporting the Neptunian hordes from dark side to sunward side of Triton, and vice versa, and it was equally evident from those throbbing mechanisms' operation, that the hour of awakening for those hordes was at hand and that these were waiting for that awakening. For there stood also, between us and the nearest of the cylinders, three tube-armed Neptunians who were conversing in brief, snapping speech as they waited!",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"Marlin and Hunt find themselves in a desperate situation on Triton as they encounter Neptunian creatures. Relying on the reduced gravity to perform incredible leaps, they attack and grapple with the creatures to prevent them from alerting the sleeping horde. Hunt manages to choke one Neptunian by blocking its mouth opening, while Marlin struggles against another. After defeating both Neptunians, they continue their escape mission through a maze of sleep compartments filled with slumbering Neptunians. They aim to find landing compartments with cylinder-fliers to escape. Their escape is complicated by the dark, the looming risk of awakening the hordes, and their unusual mode of movement. Eventually, their hope surges as they spot a larger compartment containing the sought-after cylinder-fliers. Observing three Neptunians near the cylinders conversing, they realize the urgency as the mechanisms signify the impending awakening of the horde.",1233
"Colletta, in speaking of the Carbonari, considers this sect to be derived from the Freemasons of Germany—transported into their country by the Neapolitan exiles of 1799, on their return. I have heard Italians well versed in the secrets of Carbonarism deny this. They say that the deeply religious and mystic spirit of the sect at its commencement, proves its Neapolitan origin, and that it was founded by men, Neapolitans themselves, who knew how to adapt their doctrines and their rites to the temperament of a people, at once superstitious and lovers of the marvellous.
The hopes of political liberty which all nations entertained when the armies of the allies quailed before those of republican France, found an echo in Naples; while Ferdinand and his queen, who before the French Revolution had shown an inclination to imitate Joseph and Leopold of Austria, in reforming the laws of their kingdom, taking sudden fright, indulged in such acts 165of arbitrary power as incited rather than repressed the desire for change. Many Neapolitans, therefore, welcomed the French with enthusiasm, and rejoiced in the flight of their sovereign. The liberators, as they delighted to call themselves, soon, however, showed the cloven foot, and appeared in their true light, of invaders and spoilers. The hearts of all real lovers of their country were alienated from them; and if Ferdinand, on his return, during Napoleon’s expedition to Egypt, when the French were driven from Italy, had shewn himself moderate and forgiving, he had acquired the affection of all his subjects. But both he and his queen seemed to be driven mad by hatred and terror of the new doctrine of a people’s right to be well governed. Executions—the most barbarous imprisonments—persecutions that, blinded by fury, rather attacked a friend than forgave an enemy, followed their restoration. All the constitutionalists or republicans fled—some to France, Germany, or Switzerland, some to the wild and pathless mountains of the Abruzzi and the Calabrias.
When the French returned, the situation of the exiles was not mended; and many among them continued to dwell in unknown and savage retreats, among the inaccessible mountains and solitary valleys of those regions. They lived without any bond to 166unite them together, yet not so isolated but that they frequently met, and communicated to each other their hopes and projects. More than the Bourbon who had persecuted them, they hated the usurpation of the stranger. The most earnest desire of their hearts was to drive the French from their country, while some among them, looking beyond that time, revolved the means of strengthening their party, so that a republic might be instituted; or, at any rate, if Ferdinand returned, that he should be forced to concede just and free institutions to his people.","中国的饮食文化丰富多样，每个地方都有其独特的风味和饮食习惯。在山西，人们对醋和酸菜情有独钟。你可以在这里看到一大家子人围坐在一起，欢快地享用酸菜鱼、醋溜土豆丝等菜肴。醋对于山西人来说，不仅是一种调料，更是一种生活方式。无论是大酒店还是街头小摊，山西的餐桌上总离不开这种酸酸的味道。人们爱说，山西人喝醋可以喝出健康，醋中含的多种有益成分，使他们始终精神抖擞，活力四射。

而在辽宁，严寒的冬季让人们更偏爱能御寒的食物。酸菜白肉火锅在这里十分流行，每当寒风凛冽的日子里，热气腾腾的火锅便成为一家人暖胃的最佳选择。酸菜的开胃效果加上白肉的丰润口感，使得这道菜不仅美味，而且充满了家的温暖。辽宁人习惯在元旦和春节期间围坐火锅旁，说笑之间，暖意融融地迎接新的一年。

相比之下，北京的饮食文化更为多样化。北京人不满足于单一的口味，于是羊肉酸菜汤和杂面便成了他们的得意之作。羊肉酸菜汤味道浓郁，既能暖胃，又保留了酸菜的清爽。而杂面则是一种融合了多种谷物的面食，口感独特，营养丰富。在快速步伐的都市生活中，这些传统的饮食仍能为人们带来一丝安稳和满足。

南方的福建和广西则有着不一样的美食情怀。这里的人们爱吃酸笋，无论是酸笋炒肉、酸笋炖鱼，还是与辣椒一同烹饪，皆能让人垂涎三尺。广西的傣族人尤其擅长用酸笋炖鸡，他们认为这样的搭配，不仅健脾开胃，还能驱寒祛湿，使人倍感舒适。夏天的延庆山里，还有一道特别的美食：酸饭。酸饭是将吃剩的米饭发酵后食用，口感酸甜独特，清凉爽口，是当地人避暑的最佳选择。那些到访的游客总是不禁赞叹这种朴实无华的美味。

再来看看江南的无锡和广东，这里的甜食文化享有盛誉。无锡的糖醋排骨，甜而不腻、色泽诱人，成为招牌菜之一。广东的早茶点心，精致小巧，甜美动人，每道甜品都融合了厨师的用心巧思。每每想到这些甜品，便能想象到家人围坐一起品茶吃点心的温馨画面。

北京的饮食习惯正悄悄发生变化。随着外来文化的渗透和年轻一代的口味多变，北京的食谱正在不断丰富。从传统的卤煮火烧到如今的日韩料理、东南亚美食，北京人放眼世界，吸收了各种美味的精华，形成了独特的饮食文化交融。

在北方的春天，许多人都会上山采摘苣荬菜。苣荬菜嫩绿鲜美，清苦而甘甜，是春天里最不可错过的野菜之一。经过简单的清炒或凉拌，它便成了餐桌上最天然的一道美味佳肴。

贵州的饮食同样值得一提，其中鱼腥草是当地的一道独特美味。虽然这种蔬菜气味特殊，但贵阳人却格外钟爱。用鱼腥草做成的凉拌菜或热汤，别有一番风味。而在某个剧团里，有一个干部特别喜欢吃辣椒，他每餐饭都必不可少地要加入各种辛辣调料。无论是辣子鸡、麻辣豆腐，还是一道简单的辣椒炒蛋，都能让他吃得满头大汗却笑颜逐开。

这样的饮食习惯和文化，不仅映照出各地独特的生活方式，还展示了中国人对美食的热爱与追求，这些美味佳肴让每个地方的人们在舌尖上能够寻找到家的温暖和幸福。",易,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"The passage discusses the origins and historical context of the Carbonari, a secret society in Italy.

"All this was pleasing to us, as confirming that we had learned from Vincaly Row, and when we were safely lodged that night in the rest-house of the village, and had supped well, though not extravagantly, my friend and I discoursed much of the means whereby we might soonest place ourselves in security. For it seemed, by what the Brachmine had told us, that to reach the Moratty army by the shortest way we must needs pass through a rugged country, extreme difficult to traverse with such a train as ours, while the other way, where there was a good road enough, should occupy us still two or three days. And moreover, between us and Seva Gi there lay the strong fortress of Tashpour, whence, as we had no doubt, Cogia Bux would be looking forth for us, and our train being so large, it was little like that we should be able to slip past him. These difficulties that threatened us we discussed with great freedom, at one time even purposing to abandon all our stuff (which, though valuable, was little in comparison with life), and take the short road with only our men. But telling this to Loll Duss, who was making ready where we should lie that night, he showed himself prodigiously concerned, and entreated with much respect that we would allow him to make a certain proposition to us. Which we permitting, he begged of us to leave our train in his care, both the men and all the beasts, that he might conduct it to the camp of Seva Gi by the longer road, while we, the viscount and I, rid on without encumbrance by the short way. It went to his heart (said the honest fellow) that we should be left without the attendance suited to our quality, but by submitting to this trifling inconvenience we should be secure of regaining in the space of a few days all our goods, in the stead of being compelled to undertake the rest of our journey without ’em. And this plan of his seeming to us very good and well-considered, we gave to’t our attention, and went to bed resolved upon adopting it.
And setting out in the morning as usual, lest the villagers should perceive our divided forces, we separated from one another at some distance from the place where we had slept, our servants and cooleys taking the road to the left hand, and my friend and I that to the right. Meanwhile, I was not a little exercised in my mind as to whether we were doing the best we might, and did give Loll Duss many commands touching what he should do in respect to certain dangers, as that in case of any pursuit made of them, they must all leave their packs and escape into the woods, not rashly perilling their lives for such poor silly stuff as beds and kettles. In all this he heard me very patiently, though I am well assured he would never have suffered any such thing to be done, and so we separated from them, my friend and I riding on in the sweet morning air, the which was mighty soft and agreeable, with as little concern as if that were not to be the most weighty day of both of our lives, or at least of mine.
Through all the morning we held on at a good pace, our horses being sound and swift, and at noon or thereabouts halted for a rest of two hours, for more we dared not take, if we were to reach Seva Gi and his army by sunset. Setting out again on our journey after this time of repose, we found that we must needs progress with great circumspection, since we now beheld very clearly the great citadel of Tashpour frowning from its lofty steep before us. And here the viscount showed very evidently the value of that training he had received, for his eye told him of every ridge and every grove that might afford us concealment in our riding, and we were well abreast of the fortress before we were forced to relinquish our cover. But here that which we had hailed as our salvation became, so to speak, a destruction unto us, for we had been riding in the shadow of the edge of a certain great wood, so that even had any been watching for us from the castle they had scarce been able to perceive us against the dark trees, and now we come full upon a huge quag or morass, wherein my horse had like to have sunk before I could turn him and get him out. And looking to see where this quag might end, we found that it spread into the wood for some distance (making a dark and loathsome mire and mud, very hideous to behold), nay, we could not reach with our eyes the furthest limits on’t, so that our sole plan was to ride out upon the plain and fetch a compass about it. And this, because time pressed, and we might not search in the wood, to seek the other end on’t, we did set about immediately, though doing our best to ride leisurely, so as any perceiving us might take us only for honest countrymen bent on their occasions. But when we come out upon the plain, our beasts and we were evidently visible against the clear green colour of the rushes by the side of the quag, and before we could even circle round the end on’t, the viscount bid me look round, and I obeying saw a troop of horse coming out of a gate of the castle in pursuit of us.
Now these men were so close after us that they arrived at the side of the quag nearest to the fortress when we were still riding along the further margent thereof with all possible haste for to regain our road, so that they did let fly at us with their matchlocks, as hoping thereby to cripple and so delay us. But by God’s great mercy they hit neither my friend nor me, their bullets all falling short of us, save one only, which did strike my friend’s horse, making it halt and stagger for a moment. But he calling out to it cheerfully, for he was used always to speak to his beast as though it were indeed a rational creature that could understand him, it went on again bravely, and we two rid away at our utmost speed along our road.","中国是一个幅员辽阔、文化多样的国家，不同的地域孕育了各具特色的饮食文化。谈起中国各地的饮食习惯和口味偏好，就像展开了一幅生动的美食地图。我们先从北方说起，山西是个以醋闻名的地方，当地人对于醋的喜爱可谓到了极致。无论是用醋调味还是泡菜香酸，醋在每一餐饭里都占据着重要的位置。山西人对酸菜的偏爱也不容忽视，那酸辣刺激的味道，是他们餐桌上的常客。

辽宁的饮食文化中也少不了酸菜，不过他们有自己独特的吃法——酸菜白肉火锅。每逢寒冷的冬季，辽宁人就会围坐在火锅旁，酸菜和肥嫩的白肉在锅中翻滚，汤汁沸腾，香味四溢。沾满汤汁的酸菜与鲜嫩的白肉，融合出独特的口感和无与伦比的美味。

再向南走，我们来到北京。这里的老北京人过去喜欢吃羊肉酸菜汤，那是忙碌一天后的暖心佳肴。带点微酸的汤汁搭配着柔嫩的羊肉，再来一碗杂面，是地道的北京味道。近些年，北京人的饮食习惯也在不断改变，传统与现代，美味的接力依然在继续。

而在福建和广西，人们对酸笋有着难以割舍的情愫。酸笋的酸香让人垂涎三尺，它往往作为调味或主菜出现在餐桌上。特别是广西的傣族人，他们会用酸笋炖鸡，酸笋的酸味与鸡肉的鲜美相辅相成，入口即令人回味无穷。

如果我们继续旅行，来到北京周边的延庆，夏天的山里弥漫着酸饭的香气。酸饭，是一种经过发酵的米饭，入口带有独特的酸味，清爽宜人，成为人们避暑的佳品。

接下来我们前往南方，感受甜食文化的魅力。无锡和广东无疑是甜食的天堂。无论是无锡的糖醋排骨、糕点，还是广东的双皮奶、鸡蛋仔，甜品在这里不仅仅是一种味道，更是一种生活态度。甜蜜的食物带来了无尽的幸福感和满足感。

再说到北方的饮食习惯，春天是吃苣荬菜的好时节。这种野菜富含维生素，被北方人视为春天的馈赠。苣荬菜的微苦和青涩，吃进嘴里，是春天的味道，是生命的复苏。

贵州的饮食习惯则丰富多样，提到鱼腥草，外地人可能会觉得难以接受，但贵州人对这种草药味的菜肴却情有独钟。鱼腥草凉拌、煮汤，无论怎样的烹饪方式，都受人喜爱。而剧团里一个干部吃辣椒的故事也流传不息，不论是出差在外还是在家，辣椒成了他不可或缺的生活伴侣，贵州人的辣味情结由此可见一斑。

这段旅程中，各地的酸、甜、辣味道交织成了中国饮食文化的丰富画卷。每种味道都是一个地域的故事，经过岁月的积淀，成为人们日常生活的一部分。无论是酸菜的爽脆、甜食的诱人、辣椒的辛辣，还是苣荬菜的清新、鱼腥草的独特，都是对生活的热爱与追求。",易,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"The passage narrates the journey of two friends who, on advice from Vincaly Row, aim to reach the Moratty army.

"""Yes sir,"" he said, ""efficiency ... regulation ... order ... that's what's spoiling all life these days. Those addle-headed scientists aren't satisfied unless they can dovetail everything.""
Raine smiled and in the pause that followed cast his eyes about the room. It was circular and no attempt had been made to conceal its origin: the bridge-house of some discarded space-going tug. Along the continuous wall ran a triple tier of bookshelves, but it seemed that most of the books lay scattered on the table, chairs, and floor.
Above the shelves the wall was decorated with several three-dimensional water colors, pin-up girls in various stages of undress and mounted trophies of the rather hideous game Straba provided.
""About this survey,"" the kid began.
""Only last month,"" Cap Barlow continued, unmindful of the interruption, ""a salesman stopped off here and wanted to sell me a gadget for my golf course. Said it would increase the gravitation over the fairways and prevent the ball from traveling any farther than it does on Earth.""
He spat disgustedly. ""You'd think any fool would realize it's an ideal course that can offer a Par three on a thousand yard hole.""
But Raine hadn't come this far to listen to the dissertations of an old man. He was tired from long hours of sitting at the console of his ship. He stood up wearily.
""If you'll show me where I can stow my gear,"" he said, ""I think I'll turn in and get some sleep. I've got a lot to do tomorrow.""
For a week the kid didn't bother Cap at all. Each morning he went out with a reference book, a haversack and a canteen, and he didn't show up again until dark. Cap didn't mention that Straba had been officially surveyed ten years before or that results of this survey had been practically negative as far as adding to the Interplanetary Pharmacopoeia went. If Tri-Planet wanted to train its green personnel by sending them on a wild goose chase, that was all right with Cap.
But the old man had one thing that interested young Raine: his telescope mounted in a domed observatory on the top floor. Every night, Raine spent hours staring through that scope, sighting stars, marking them on the charts. Cap tried to tell him that those charts were as perfect as human intellect could make them. Raine had an answer for that too.
""Those charts are three years old,"" he said. ""In three years a whole universe could be created or destroyed. Take a look at this star on Graph 5. I've been watching it, and the way it's acting convinces me there's another star, probably a Wanderer, approaching it from here."" He indicated a spot on the chart.
He was efficient and persistent. He watched his star, checked and rechecked his calculation, and in the end, to Cap's amazement sighted the Wanderer almost exactly where he said it would be.
That discovery only excited him more and after that he spent an even greater amount of time in the observatory. Then late one night he came to the top of the stairs and called for Cap.
Cap went up to the scope, and at first he didn't see anything. Then he did see it: a darker shadow against the interrupted starlight.
""It's a ship,"" the old man said.
Raine nodded. ""My guess too. But what's it doing out of regular space lanes?""
""You forget you landed here yourself. Straba does occasionally attract a visitor. Her crew may need water or food.""
Raine shook his head. ""I hedge-hopped in from asteroid, Torela. This fellow seems to be coming from deep space.""
They continued to watch that approaching shadow, taking turns at looking through the scope. It seemed to take a long time coming; but finally there was a roar and a rush of air and a black shape hurtled out of the eastern sky. The two men ran outside where Cap began to curse volubly. The ship's anti-gravs were only partially on. It had hit hard, digging up three hundred yards of the sixteenth fairway and completely ruined two greens.
Then the dust cleared and the two men stared. The ship was a derelict, a piece of space flotsam. There was no question about that. It was also a Cyblla-style coach, one of the first Earth-made passenger freighters to utilize a power-pile drive, designed when streamlining was thought to mean following the shape of a cigar. On her bow was a name but meteorite shrapnel had partially obliterated the letters.
""Jingoes,"" said Raine, ""I never saw a ship like this before. She must be old—really old!""
The hatches were badly fused and oxidized, and it was evident that without a blaster it would be impossible to get in. Cap shrugged.
""Let her stay there,"" he said. ""I can make a dog-leg out of the fifteenth, and keep the course fairly playable. And if I get tired of seeing that big hulk out of my dining room window I can always plant some python vines around the nearside of her.""
Raine shook his head quickly. ""There's no telling what we may find inside. We've got to find an opening.""
He went over the ship like a squirrel looking for a nut. Back under her stern quarter, just abaft her implosion plates, he found a small refuse scuttle which seemed movable. He took drills and went to work on it.
Three hours later the two men were inside. There was nothing unusual about the crew quarters or the adjoining storage space. But when they reached the control cabin they stood and gaped.
It was like entering a museum. The bulkheads were covered with queer glass dials, and several panels of manual operating switches. The power-pile conduits were shielded with lead—lead mind you—and the lighting was apparently done with some kind of fluorescent tubes bracketed to the ceiling. It brought Cap back to the time he was a kid and his grandfather told him stories and legends of the past.
Just above the pilot's old-fashioned cosmoscope was a fancy metal plate with the ship's name stamped on it. Perseus!",中国的饮食文化丰富多彩，每个地方的人们都有自己独特的饮食习惯和口味偏好。这些习惯不仅反映了地域特色，也展示了人们对美味的追求。山西，这片黄土地上的居民，几乎每一餐都离不开醋。在他们的日常生活中，不管是调味还是腌制，醋都是不可或缺的存在。特别是那种酸爽的酸菜，总能勾起山西人舌尖上的记忆。而在东北的辽宁，酸菜白肉火锅成为了家常美味。寒冷的冬天，热气腾腾的酸菜白肉火锅不仅能够暖身，还能通过酸爽的口味让人胃口大开。来到北京，羊肉酸菜汤和杂面更是北京人桌上的常客。每当寒冷的北风吹起，人们总会聚在一起，吃上一碗热腾腾的酸菜羊肉汤，再配上一碗扎实的杂面，身体也跟着暖了起来。南方的饮食文化则更多样，福建和广西的居民对酸笋情有独钟。无论是酸笋炒肉还是酸笋炖鸡，这种带有独特香气的食材总是能够让每一位食客回味无穷。在傣族的饮食文化中，酸笋炖鸡更是不可或缺的佳肴，这道菜不仅保留了鸡肉的鲜美，还通过酸笋的点缀增添了一份别样的风味。同样的酸味也出现在延庆的夏日街头。这里的夏天人们喜欢吃酸饭，那种经过发酵的米饭，总能在暖风中散发出一股清新的酸香。谈到甜食的世界，无锡和广东可谓是甜食天堂。无锡的点心和糖果甜而不腻，无论是桂花糕还是豆沙包，每一口都充满了幸福感。而广东的甜品更是琳琅满目，双皮奶、糖水、龟苓膏，每个甜品都带有独特的风味，满足了人们对甜的所有想象。而对于北京来说，饮食习惯随着时代不断变化。然而，无论如何变化，那些老北京的味道总是让人难以忘怀。记得小时候，街边的小吃摊前总是排满了人。那些传统的小吃、火烧、卤煮、什锦菜，每一个味道都印刻在人们的记忆中。到了春天，北方人习惯吃苣荬菜。这种野菜带有一丝苦涩，却能通过巧妙的烹饪手法变得清香可口，成为春日里的美味。而在贵州的山水之间，当地人喜欢吃鱼腥草，这种带有独特香气的野菜常被用来凉拌或者入汤，虽然味道独特，却深得人心。最后，不得不提到剧团里的那个干部，他对辣椒的钟爱简直到了痴迷的程度。无论在哪，他的盘子中总是少不了辣椒的身影。据说，他甚至能徒手吃下一整只辣椒，而丝毫不畏惧那股强烈的辣味。中国的饮食文化，就像一个五彩缤纷的拼图，每一块都展示了不同的味道和情感。这些独特的地域风味，不仅仅是人们日常生活的一部分，更是中华文化深厚底蕴的体现。,易,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"Raine arrives at Straba to conduct a survey and stays with Cap Barlow.

It seemed to take a long time coming; but finally there was a roar and a rush of air and a black shape hurtled out of the eastern sky. The two men ran outside where Cap began to curse volubly. The ship's anti-gravs were only partially on. It had hit hard, digging up three hundred yards of the sixteenth fairway and completely ruined two greens.
Then the dust cleared and the two men stared. The ship was a derelict, a piece of space flotsam. There was no question about that. It was also a Cyblla-style coach, one of the first Earth-made passenger freighters to utilize a power-pile drive, designed when streamlining was thought to mean following the shape of a cigar. On her bow was a name but meteorite shrapnel had partially obliterated the letters.
""Jingoes,"" said Raine, ""I never saw a ship like this before. She must be old—really old!""
The hatches were badly fused and oxidized, and it was evident that without a blaster it would be impossible to get in. Cap shrugged.
""Let her stay there,"" he said. ""I can make a dog-leg out of the fifteenth, and keep the course fairly playable. And if I get tired of seeing that big hulk out of my dining room window I can always plant some python vines around the nearside of her.""
Raine shook his head quickly. ""There's no telling what we may find inside. We've got to find an opening.""
He went over the ship like a squirrel looking for a nut. Back under her stern quarter, just abaft her implosion plates, he found a small refuse scuttle which seemed movable. He took drills and went to work on it.
Three hours later the two men were inside. There was nothing unusual about the crew quarters or the adjoining storage space. But when they reached the control cabin they stood and gaped.
It was like entering a museum. The bulkheads were covered with queer glass dials, and several panels of manual operating switches. The power-pile conduits were shielded with lead—lead mind you—and the lighting was apparently done with some kind of fluorescent tubes bracketed to the ceiling. It brought Cap back to the time he was a kid and his grandfather told him stories and legends of the past.

"""Yes sir,"" he said, ""efficiency ... regulation ... order ... that's what's spoiling all life these days. Those addle-headed scientists aren't satisfied unless they can dovetail everything.""
Raine smiled and in the pause that followed cast his eyes about the room. It was circular and no attempt had been made to conceal its origin: the bridge-house of some discarded space-going tug. Along the continuous wall ran a triple tier of bookshelves, but it seemed that most of the books lay scattered on the table, chairs, and floor.
Above the shelves the wall was decorated with several three-dimensional water colors, pin-up girls in various stages of undress and mounted trophies of the rather hideous game Straba provided.
""About this survey,"" the kid began.
""Only last month,"" Cap Barlow continued, unmindful of the interruption, ""a salesman stopped off here and wanted to sell me a gadget for my golf course. Said it would increase the gravitation over the fairways and prevent the ball from traveling any farther than it does on Earth.""
He spat disgustedly. ""You'd think any fool would realize it's an ideal course that can offer a Par three on a thousand yard hole.""
But Raine hadn't come this far to listen to the dissertations of an old man. He was tired from long hours of sitting at the console of his ship. He stood up wearily.
""If you'll show me where I can stow my gear,"" he said, ""I think I'll turn in and get some sleep. I've got a lot to do tomorrow.""
For a week the kid didn't bother Cap at all. Each morning he went out with a reference book, a haversack and a canteen, and he didn't show up again until dark. Cap didn't mention that Straba had been officially surveyed ten years before or that results of this survey had been practically negative as far as adding to the Interplanetary Pharmacopoeia went. If Tri-Planet wanted to train its green personnel by sending them on a wild goose chase, that was all right with Cap.
But the old man had one thing that interested young Raine: his telescope mounted in a domed observatory on the top floor. Every night, Raine spent hours staring through that scope, sighting stars, marking them on the charts. Cap tried to tell him that those charts were as perfect as human intellect could make them. Raine had an answer for that too.
""Those charts are three years old,"" he said. ""In three years a whole universe could be created or destroyed. Take a look at this star on Graph 7. I've been watching it, and the way it's acting convinces me there's another star, probably a Wanderer, approaching it from here."" He indicated a spot on the chart.
He was efficient and persistent. He watched his star, checked and rechecked his calculation, and in the end, to Cap's amazement sighted the Wanderer almost exactly where he said it would be.
That discovery only excited him more and after that he spent an even greater amount of time in the observatory. Then late one night he came to the top of the stairs and called for Cap.
Cap went up to the scope, and at first he didn't see anything. Then he did see it: a darker shadow against the interrupted starlight.
""It's a ship,"" the old man said.
Raine nodded. ""My guess too. But what's it doing out of regular space lanes?""
""You forget you landed here yourself. Straba does occasionally attract a visitor. Her crew may need water or food.""
Raine shook his head. ""I hedge-hopped in from asteroid, Torela. This fellow seems to be coming from deep space.""

"Sar stared at him in awe, as one would stare at an unbelievable monstrosity, born in a fertilely imaginative mind and portrayed in the TDs by an actor suitably deformed by the genius of make-up. But this was no TD image—this monster was real and he was standing only a few feet away, leering at her, challenging her, hurting her, condemning her.
They knew that she could bring forth no witnesses in her defense. That was what made the challenge so cruel. They knew that she had had no lovers since before her first child was born, nineteen years ago. She had been a virtuous wife, a faithful wife. And now they were turning her very virtue against her!
""Do you have such a witness?"" Justice Klyutch asked her attorney.
""I ask the court's permission to confer privately with my client,"" the lawyer replied, rising hastily from his seat.
""Granted.""
""No,"" Sar said abruptly. Her lawyer had hardly started across the room to the witness seat when her voice stopped him. ""No,"" Sar repeated, ""we have no witness.""
""Your Honors,"" her lawyer said hurriedly, ""I request that my client's remark be stricken from the record. It was not made in reply to a question, nor was it on advice of counsel."" To Sar he said, ""Please, Mrs. Wisson, do not volunteer information before you consult me.""

""No,"" Sar pronounced, finally. ""There has been no one. I won't invent a mythical lover. We have no witness.""
The lawyer returned to his seat dejectedly. Sar had ruined whatever chance he might have had to bring in a false witness to dispute those presented by her husband.
If the court accepted the testimony of the four supposed lovers, the case was lost. Even without their testimony, it was a toss-up between Sar's word and her husband's. After all, records of an ability possessed twenty years ago really proved nothing about the present. So what if she had been an exceptionally apt student in school? After twenty years, she might be different—altogether different. She might very well be incompetent.
Sar, too, knew that she had spoiled her own opportunity to counteract the fraudulent testimony of her husband's friends. Yet, although she was afraid of the consequences of losing the case, she could not bring herself to lie about her private life. She could not claim lovers she had not had. It was ridiculous, she knew, in this day and age, but she was actually proud of her fidelity.

辽宁人的餐桌同样少不了酸菜，酸菜白肉火锅更是他们的冬季挚爱。这道菜不仅能够驱寒保暖，还在一锅内巧妙融合了酸爽与肉香，成为了东北冬季的一道靓丽风景。在北京，虽然气候条件与辽东相近，但饮食习惯却有些许不同。北京人偏爱羊肉酸菜汤，那浓郁的汤底既有羊肉的鲜美，又有酸菜的爽口，再配上一碗杂面，别有一番滋味。

南下至福建和广西，人们宛若步入另一个酸味的天地。两地人对酸笋推崇备至，酸笋不仅是烹饪的必备佐料，还成为了当地的饮食标志。尤其是广西的酸笋炖鸡，更是将酸与鲜的完美结合提升到了新的境界。在大山深处的傣族居住地，无论是节庆还是日常，酸笋炖鸡都是那样的不可或缺，酸笋的爽脆与鸡肉的嫩滑交织成了一种独特的味觉享受。

即便到了延庆山区，夏天吃酸饭的习俗依旧延续。对于延庆人来说，酸饭不仅仅是食物，更是一种传承，寄托着对祖辈生活的浓浓怀念。无锡和广东则是甜食的王国。无锡的各种甜点，糖汁粘稠、香甜可口，广东更是以甜食闻名。尤其是在一些广场，随处可见人们用糖浆在纸上绘制的美丽图案，流淌出关于甜蜜生活的美好憧憬。

北京的饮食文化伴随着社会的变迁在不断演变。昔日的老北京可能更倾向于传统的面食和清淡的口味，但如今，随着年轻一代的崛起和外来文化的影响，北京人的饮食习惯已开拓至五湖四海，南北风味皆受青睐。春天时的北方，人们喜欢采摘苣荬菜，用其制作各类小菜。苣荬菜不仅味美，还有清热解毒的功效，是春季时节的最佳选择。

贵州的饮食与众不同，鱼腥草在这里被视为珍馐美味，其独特的香气常常让外地人望而却步，却是贵州人餐桌上的常客。此外，还有一个鲜为人知的细节，在某剧团里，那里的干部对辣椒情有独钟，他可以毫不犹豫地将辣椒当作零食一般食用。辣椒在他的生活中不仅仅是一味调料，更像是一种能够给予力量和勇气的良友。

总之，中国各地的饮食习惯和口味偏好各有千秋，这些多样化的饮食习惯不仅丰富了中国的美食文化，也成就了各地人与众不同的饮食记忆。无论酸、甜、苦、辣，这些味道都在中国饮食文化中烙下了深深的印记，成为人们味蕾与情感的纽带，谱写着属于中国美食的绚丽篇章。",易,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"Sar is being scrutinized in court, accused of infidelity, and faces false testimony from her husband's supposed witnesses.

"As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal, and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft, unless they previously produced their papers.
“What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?” said I, now jumping on the bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.
“I mean,” he replied, “he must show his papers.”
“Yes,” said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from behind Peleg’s, out of the wigwam. “He must show that he’s converted. Son of darkness,” he added, turning to Queequeg, “art thou at present in communion with any Christian church?”
“Why,” said I, “he’s a member of the first Congregational Church.” Here be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches.
“First Congregational Church,” cried Bildad, “what! that worships in Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman’s meeting-house?” and so saying, taking out his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at Queequeg.
“How long hath he been a member?” he then said, turning to me; “not very long, I rather guess, young man.”
“No,” said Peleg, “and he hasn’t been baptized right either, or it would have washed some of that devil’s blue off his face.”
“Do tell, now,” cried Bildad, “is this Philistine a regular member of Deacon Deuteronomy’s meeting? I never saw him going there, and I pass it every Lord’s day.”
“I don’t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting,” said I; “all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First Congregational Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.”
“Young man,” said Bildad sternly, “thou art skylarking with me—explain thyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean? answer me.”
Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. “I mean, sir, the same ancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there, and Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother’s son and soul of us belong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in that we all join hands.”
“Splice, thou mean’st splice hands,” cried Peleg, drawing nearer. “Young man, you’d better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast hand; I never heard a better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy—why Father Mapple himself couldn’t beat it, and he’s reckoned something. Come aboard, come aboard; never mind about the papers. I say, tell Quohog there—what’s that you call him? tell Quohog to step along. By the great anchor, what a harpoon he’s got there! looks like good stuff that; and he handles it about right. I say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did you ever stand in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a fish?”
Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon the bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats hanging to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his harpoon, cried out in some such way as this:—
“Cap’ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You see him? well, spose him one whale eye, well, den!” and taking sharp aim at it, he darted the iron right over old Bildad’s broad brim, clean across the ship’s decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.
“Now,” said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, “spos-ee him whale-e eye; why, dad whale dead.”
“Quick, Bildad,” said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin gangway. “Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship’s papers. We must have Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye, Quohog, we’ll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that’s more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.”
So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon enrolled among the same ship’s company to which I myself belonged.
When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for signing, he turned to me and said, “I guess, Quohog there don’t know how to write, does he? I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark?”
But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the offered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm; so that through Captain Peleg’s obstinate mistake touching his appellative, it stood something like this:—
Quohog. his X mark.
Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg, and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one entitled “The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose,” placed it in Queequeg’s hands, and then grasping them and the book with both his, looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, “Son of darkness, I must do my duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways, which I sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial bondsman. Spurn the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the wrath to come; mind thine eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer clear of the fiery pit!”
Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad’s language, heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.
“Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our harpooneer,” cried Peleg. “Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers—it takes the shark out of ’em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish. There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the meeting, and never came to good. He got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he shrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear of after-claps, in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones.”
“Peleg! Peleg!” said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, “thou thyself, as I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest, Peleg, what it is to have the fear of death; how, then, can’st thou prate in this ungodly guise. Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on Japan, that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab, did’st thou not think of Death and the Judgment then?”
“Hear him, hear him now,” cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,—“hear him, all of ye. Think of that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink! Death and the Judgment then? What? With all three masts making such an everlasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over us, fore and aft. Think of Death and the Judgment then? No! no time to think about Death then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of; and how to save all hands—how to rig jury-masts—how to get into the nearest port; that was what I was thinking of.”
Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck, where we followed him. There he stood, very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist. Now and then he stooped to pick up a patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which otherwise might have been wasted.","在中国这片辽阔的土地上，各地的人们因为地理位置、气候条件和历史文化的不同，形成了丰富多彩的饮食习惯和口味偏好。每一个地方都有一种独特的味道，深深植根于当地人的生活中，成为他们难以割舍的记忆和文化的一部分。

山西人素有“百姓百味”之称，而在各味之中，醋是他们的最爱。无论是面食还是小菜，少不了淋上一勺香醇醋。酸菜更是他们的常见美食，从冬日的早晨到夏日的午后，一碗碗酸菜面让他们的生活充满了酸爽的快乐。

在辽宁，寒冷的冬天里，酸菜白肉火锅是人们餐桌上的宠儿。将酸菜和肥美的白肉在铜锅中慢慢煮沸，配上几瓣蒜，满满的温暖从心底涌上，让整个冬天都变得不那么严峻。也许，这正是北方人通过饮食来抵御严寒的智慧。

北京的饮食文化既传统又包容，从历史上宫廷美食到现代化的城市餐桌，变化万千。北京人爱喝的羊肉酸菜汤，有着浓郁的地方特色和独特的风味，一碗汤，带着老北京的讲究和底蕴。杂面则充满了家的味道，每一份杂面都是对家庭温情的再现。

偏南的福建和广西，则钟情于酸笋。酸笋的奇特风味，酸爽中带着一丝清香，既可以焖炖，也可以清炒，百吃不厌。傣族人更擅长用酸笋炖鸡，浓郁的鸡汤中透着酸笋的清香，令人食指大动，唇齿留香。

在延庆山里，夏天人们爱吃一种叫做酸饭的美食。酸饭，是用糯米发酵制成的食品，味道酸爽，入口即化。在炎热的夏季，凉凉的酸饭不仅解暑，更是对胃口的一种调剂。

无锡和广东的甜食文化，也各有特色。无锡的点心甜而不腻，而广东的糖水和甜品则有着南方的精致和清甜。甜食不仅仅是味觉的享受，更是生活的调味剂，为人们带来无数的小幸福。

随着时代的发展，北京人的饮食习惯也在发生变化。传统的美食依然在，越来越多的外来美食也融入了北京人的餐桌，多样性和包容性成为了北京饮食文化的新特点。北京人春天喜欢吃苣荬菜，这种苦涩中带着清爽的野菜不仅是季节的鲜美，更是对自然的回归和亲近。

而贵州人则钟情于鱼腥草，这种特殊的草药味道独特，可用于各种菜肴，既健康又美味。有时候，剧团的干部喜欢在饭桌上拿出一串串辣椒，边吃边聊，辣味刺激了味蕾，也激发了思维的火花。

中国的美食文化，正是这些多样的饮食习惯和口味偏好，共同编织成了一幅丰富多彩的画卷。无论是在北方的寒冬，还是在南方的炎夏，每一份食物都承载着地域的风土人情和千家万户的酸甜苦辣。",易,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"In this passage, the narrator and Queequeg, carrying his harpoon, are intercepted by Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad as they approach a ship. Captain Peleg, upon realizing Queequeg is a 'cannibal,' insists he must show conversion papers to Christianity before boarding.

"As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal, and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft, unless they previously produced their papers.
“What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?” said I, now jumping on the bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.
“I mean,” he replied, “he must show his papers.”
“Yes,” said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from behind Peleg’s, out of the wigwam. “He must show that he’s converted. Son of darkness,” he added, turning to Queequeg, “art thou at present in communion with any Christian church?”
“Why,” said I, “he’s a member of the first Congregational Church.” Here be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches.
“First Congregational Church,” cried Bildad, “what! that worships in Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman’s meeting-house?” and so saying, taking out his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at Queequeg.
“How long hath he been a member?” he then said, turning to me; “not very long, I rather guess, young man.”
“No,” said Peleg, “and he hasn’t been baptized right either, or it would have washed some of that devil’s blue off his face.”
“Do tell, now,” cried Bildad, “is this Philistine a regular member of Deacon Deuteronomy’s meeting? I never saw him going there, and I pass it every Lord’s day.”
“I don’t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting,” said I; “all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First Congregational Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.”
“Young man,” said Bildad sternly, “thou art skylarking with me—explain thyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean? answer me.”
Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. “I mean, sir, the same ancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there, and Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother’s son and soul of us belong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in that we all join hands.”
“Splice, thou mean’st splice hands,” cried Peleg, drawing nearer. “Young man, you’d better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast hand; I never heard a better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy—why Father Mapple himself couldn’t beat it, and he’s reckoned something. Come aboard, come aboard; never mind about the papers. I say, tell Quohog there—what’s that you call him? tell Quohog to step along. By the great anchor, what a harpoon he’s got there! looks like good stuff that; and he handles it about right. I say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did you ever stand in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a fish?”
Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon the bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats hanging to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his harpoon, cried out in some such way as this:—
“Cap’ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You see him? well, spose him one whale eye, well, den!” and taking sharp aim at it, he darted the iron right over old Bildad’s broad brim, clean across the ship’s decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.
“Now,” said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, “spos-ee him whale-e eye; why, dad whale dead.”
“Quick, Bildad,” said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin gangway. “Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship’s papers. We must have Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye, Quohog, we’ll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that’s more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.”
So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon enrolled among the same ship’s company to which I myself belonged.
When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for signing, he turned to me and said, “I guess, Quohog there don’t know how to write, does he? I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark?”
But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the offered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm; so that through Captain Peleg’s obstinate mistake touching his appellative, it stood something like this:—
Quohog. his X mark.
Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg, and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one entitled “The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose,” placed it in Queequeg’s hands, and then grasping them and the book with both his, looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, “Son of darkness, I must do my duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways, which I sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial bondsman. Spurn the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the wrath to come; mind thine eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer clear of the fiery pit!”
Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad’s language, heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.
“Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our harpooneer,” cried Peleg. “Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers—it takes the shark out of ’em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish. There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the meeting, and never came to good. He got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he shrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear of after-claps, in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones.”
“Peleg! Peleg!” said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, “thou thyself, as I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest, Peleg, what it is to have the fear of death; how, then, can’st thou prate in this ungodly guise. Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on Japan, that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab, did’st thou not think of Death and the Judgment then?”
“Hear him, hear him now,” cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,—“hear him, all of ye. Think of that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink! Death and the Judgment then? What? With all three masts making such an everlasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over us, fore and aft. Think of Death and the Judgment then? No! no time to think about Death then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of; and how to save all hands—how to rig jury-masts—how to get into the nearest port; that was what I was thinking of.”
Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck, where we followed him. There he stood, very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist. Now and then he stooped to pick up a patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which otherwise might have been wasted.",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"In this passage, the narrator and Queequeg, carrying his harpoon, are intercepted by Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad as they approach a ship.

"LIZABETH’S impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.
Miss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given him.
“His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment.{279}”
“Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”
“Blame you! Oh, no.”
“But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”
“No—I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”
“But you will know it, when I have told you what happened the very next day.”
She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane, who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual! Nor was Darcy’s vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other.
“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr. Darcy’s, but you shall do as you choose.”
It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.
“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief.{280} And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing, I am sure you must feel it so.”
“Oh no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.”
“Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner.”
“There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it.”
“I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do.”
“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one’s genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”
“Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now.”
“Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I was very uncomfortable—I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to of what I felt, no Jane to comfort me, and say that I had not been so very weak, and{281} vain, and nonsensical, as I knew I had! Oh, how I wanted you!”
“How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they do appear wholly undeserved.”
“Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham’s character.”
Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your own opinion?”","中国，这片辽阔的土地上拥有多样化的地理风貌和丰富的人文历史，也孕育出了五花八门的饮食文化。南方与北方，东西之间，不同地区的人们有着各自独特的饮食习惯和口味偏好，这些饮食习惯仿佛是地域文化的缩影，映射出千姿百态的生活方式和价值观念。

在北方的山西，醋成为了不可或缺的调味料。无论是酸辣汤还是山西刀削面，一滴醋都能在舌尖上迸发出极致的美味。山西人对酸的钟爱使得酸菜成为餐桌上的常客，尤其是在冬天，酸菜炖粉条是一道必不可少的暖胃佳肴。在东北的辽宁，酸菜白肉火锅则是人们在寒冷冬季里的慰藉，一口烫菜，一口白肉，浓浓的东北味道便浸润在热气腾腾的火锅中。

当我们来到首都北京，北京人的口味则是多元而包容的。北京人喜欢羊肉酸菜汤，这道菜既有羊肉的鲜香，又有酸菜的清爽；加上杂面，整道菜肴变得更加丰富而美味。近年来，北京人的饮食习惯也在悄然发生变化，健康饮食和绿色蔬菜逐渐成为餐桌的主流，尤其是北方春天，苣荬菜成为了当季时令蔬菜，成为备受青睐的美食。

沿着东南沿海来到福建，这里的人们则喜欢酸笋，那种独特的酸味往往让人欲罢不能。无论是酸笋炒肉还是酸笋炖猪脚，都能勾起他们的食欲。往西南看，广西人也同样对酸笋情有独钟，广西的酸笋鱼尤为人们所喜欢，他们认为那是对鱼的最佳烹饪方式。

在广阔的西南地区，傣族人把酸笋炖鸡视为珍馐美馔。酸笋的酸味与鸡肉的鲜美融合在一起，吃在嘴里，酸爽脆嫩，顿时让人回味无穷。在大山深处的延庆，夏天的山里人家会享用一道特别的食品——酸饭。酸饭是由大米发酵而成，具有独特的酸味，吃起来清凉爽口，是夏季消暑的妙品。

无锡和广东则以甜食著称。无锡人喜欢甜口的食品，比如糖藕、甜酒酿，而广东的甜食则更加丰富，双皮奶、糖水、小炒，甜蜜的味道仿佛在每一口中都有回忆的韵律。在这里，甜食不仅仅是味觉的享受，更是一种生活态度的体现。

贵州人的饮食习惯同样独特。鱼腥草是一种当地人经常食用的蔬菜，尽管气味特殊，但贵州人却对它情有独钟，认为其不仅美味还具有药用价值。在不同的场合，还有人喜欢挑战辣味，例如在一家剧团里，有一个干部特别喜欢吃辣椒，常常能看到他大口大口地嚼着鲜辣的红椒，享受着辣味带来的刺激与快感。

这片大地的饮食文化不仅是味觉的盛宴，更是在时间长河中积淀下来的文化精粹。无论是酸、甜，还是辣，这些丰富的味道背后藏着的是人们对生活的热爱，对自然的敬畏和对家庭的责任感。中国的饮食文化如同一幅色彩斑斓的画卷，每一个地方、每一种习惯，都是在这幅画卷上点缀的美丽彩图。",易,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"Elizabeth eagerly shares with Jane the details of Mr. Darcy's unexpected proposal and subsequent letter revealing the true nature of George Wickham.

“How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they do appear wholly undeserved.”
“Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham’s character.”

"LIZABETH’S impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.
Miss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given him.
“His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment.{279}”
“Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”
“Blame you! Oh, no.”
“But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”
“No—I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”
“But you will know it, when I have told you what happened the very next day.”
She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane, who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual! Nor was Darcy’s vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other.
“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr. Darcy’s, but you shall do as you choose.”
It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.
“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief.{280} And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing, I am sure you must feel it so.”
“Oh no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.”
“Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner.”
“There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it.”
“I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do.”
“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one’s genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”
“Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now.”
“Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I was very uncomfortable—I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to of what I felt, no Jane to comfort me, and say that I had not been so very weak, and{283} vain, and nonsensical, as I knew I had! Oh, how I wanted you!”

"Well, I warn’t long making him understand I warn’t dead. I was ever so glad to see Jim. I warn’t lonesome now. I told him I warn’t afraid of him telling the people where I was. I talked along, but he only set there and looked at me; never said nothing. Then I says:
“It’s good daylight. Le’s get breakfast. Make up your camp fire good.”
“What’s de use er makin’ up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich truck? But you got a gun, hain’t you? Den we kin git sumfn better den strawbries.”
“Strawberries and such truck,” I says. “Is that what you live on?”
“I couldn’ git nuffn else,” he says.
“Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?”
“I come heah de night arter you’s killed.”
“What, all that time?”
“Yes—indeedy.”
“And ain’t you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?”
“No, sah—nuffn else.”
“Well, you must be most starved, ain’t you?”
“I reck’n I could eat a hoss. I think I could. How long you ben on de islan’?”
“Since the night I got killed.”
“No! W’y, what has you lived on? But you got a gun. Oh, yes, you got a gun. Dat’s good. Now you kill sumfn en I’ll make up de fire.”
So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the nigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him with his knife, and fried him.
When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot. Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved. Then when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied. By-and-by Jim says:
“But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat ’uz killed in dat shanty ef it warn’t you?”
Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart. He said Tom Sawyer couldn’t get up no better plan than what I had. Then I says:
“How do you come to be here, Jim, and how’d you get here?”
He looked pretty uneasy, and didn’t say nothing for a minute. Then he says:
“Maybe I better not tell.”
“Why, Jim?”
“Well, dey’s reasons. But you wouldn’ tell on me ef I uz to tell you, would you, Huck?”
“Blamed if I would, Jim.”
“Well, I b’lieve you, Huck. I—I run off.”
“Jim!”
“But mind, you said you wouldn’ tell—you know you said you wouldn’ tell, Huck.”
“Well, I did. I said I wouldn’t, and I’ll stick to it. Honest injun, I will. People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for keeping mum—but that don’t make no difference. I ain’t a-going to tell, and I ain’t a-going back there, anyways. So, now, le’s know all about it.”
“Well, you see, it ’uz dis way. Ole missus—dat’s Miss Watson—she pecks on me all de time, en treats me pooty rough, but she awluz said she wouldn’ sell me down to Orleans. But I noticed dey wuz a nigger trader roun’ de place considable lately, en I begin to git oneasy. Well, one night I creeps to de do’ pooty late, en de do’ warn’t quite shet, en I hear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans, but she didn’ want to, but she could git eight hund’d dollars for me, en it ’uz sich a big stack o’ money she couldn’ resis’. De widder she try to git her to say she wouldn’ do it, but I never waited to hear de res’. I lit out mighty quick, I tell you.
“I tuck out en shin down de hill, en ’spec to steal a skift ’long de sho’ som’ers ’bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring yit, so I hid in de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to go ’way. Well, I wuz dah all night.

Sometimes dey’d pull up at de sho’ en take a res’ b’fo’ dey started acrost, so by de talk I got to know all ’bout de killin’. I ’uz powerful sorry you’s killed, Huck, but I ain’t no mo’ now.
“I laid dah under de shavin’s all day.

De yuther servants wouldn’ miss me, kase dey’d shin out en take holiday soon as de ole folks ’uz out’n de way.
“Well, when it come dark I tuck out up de river road, en went ’bout two mile er more to whah dey warn’t no houses. I’d made up my mine ’bout what I’s agwyne to do. You see, ef I kep’ on tryin’ to git away afoot, de dogs ’ud track me; ef I stole a skift to cross over, dey’d miss dat skift, you see, en dey’d know ’bout whah I’d lan’ on de yuther side, en whah to pick up my track. So I says, a raff is what I’s arter; it doan’ make no track.
“I see a light a-comin’ roun’ de p’int bymeby, so I wade’ in en shove’ a log ahead o’ me en swum more’n half way acrost de river, en got in ’mongst de drift-wood, en kep’ my head down low, en kinder swum agin de current tell de raff come along. Den I swum to de stern uv it en tuck a-holt. It clouded up en ’uz pooty dark for a little while. So I clumb up en laid down on de planks. De men ’uz all ’way yonder in de middle, whah de lantern wuz.

“But I didn’ have no luck. When we ’uz mos’ down to de head er de islan’ a man begin to come aft wid de lantern, I see it warn’t no use fer to wait, so I slid overboard en struck out fer de islan’. Well, I had a notion I could lan’ mos’ anywhers, but I couldn’t—bank too bluff. I ’uz mos’ to de foot er de islan’ b’fo’ I found’ a good place. I went into de woods en jedged I wouldn’ fool wid raffs no mo’, long as dey move de lantern roun’ so. I had my pipe en a plug er dog-leg, en some matches in my cap, en dey warn’t wet, so I ’uz all right.”
“And so you ain’t had no meat nor bread to eat all this time? Why didn’t you get mud-turkles?”
“How you gwyne to git ’m? You can’t slip up on um en grab um; en how’s a body gwyne to hit um wid a rock? How could a body do it in de night? En I warn’t gwyne to show mysef on de bank in de daytime.”
“Well, that’s so. You’ve had to keep in the woods all the time, of course. Did you hear ’em shooting the cannon?”
“Oh, yes. I knowed dey was arter you. I see um go by heah—watched um thoo de bushes.”
Some young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and lighting. Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain. He said it was a sign when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the same way when young birds done it. I was going to catch some of them, but Jim wouldn’t let me. He said it was death. He said his father laid mighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old granny said his father would die, and he did.
And Jim said you mustn’t count the things you are going to cook for dinner, because that would bring bad luck. The same if you shook the table-cloth after sundown. And he said if a man owned a beehive and that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next morning, or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die. Jim said bees wouldn’t sting idiots; but I didn’t believe that, because I had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn’t sting me.
I had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them. Jim knowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything. I said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked him if there warn’t any good-luck signs. He says:
“Mighty few—an’ dey ain’t no use to a body. What you want to know when good luck’s a-comin’ for? Want to keep it off?” And he said: “Ef you’s got hairy arms en a hairy breas’, it’s a sign dat you’s agwyne to be rich. Well, dey’s some use in a sign like dat, ’kase it’s so fur ahead. You see, maybe you’s got to be po’ a long time fust, en so you might git discourage’ en kill yo’sef ’f you didn’ know by de sign dat you gwyne to be rich bymeby.”
“Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?”
“What’s de use to ax dat question? Don’t you see I has?”
“Well, are you rich?”
“No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin. Wunst I had foteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat’n’, en got busted out.”
“What did you speculate in, Jim?”
“Well, fust I tackled stock.”
“What kind of stock?”
“Why, live stock—cattle, you know. I put ten dollars in a cow. But I ain’ gwyne to resk no mo’ money in stock. De cow up ’n’ died on my han’s.”
“So you lost the ten dollars.”
“No, I didn’t lose it all. I on’y los’ ’bout nine of it. I sole de hide en taller for a dollar en ten cents.”

"Well, I warn’t long making him understand I warn’t dead. I was ever so glad to see Jim. I warn’t lonesome now. I told him I warn’t afraid of him telling the people where I was. I talked along, but he only set there and looked at me; never said nothing. Then I says:
“It’s good daylight. Le’s get breakfast. Make up your camp fire good.”
“What’s de use er makin’ up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich truck? But you got a gun, hain’t you? Den we kin git sumfn better den strawbries.”
“Strawberries and such truck,” I says. “Is that what you live on?”
“I couldn’ git nuffn else,” he says.
“Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?”
“I come heah de night arter you’s killed.”
“What, all that time?”
“Yes—indeedy.”
“And ain’t you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?”
“No, sah—nuffn else.”
“Well, you must be most starved, ain’t you?”
“I reck’n I could eat a hoss. I think I could. How long you ben on de islan’?”
“Since the night I got killed.”
“No! W’y, what has you lived on? But you got a gun. Oh, yes, you got a gun. Dat’s good. Now you kill sumfn en I’ll make up de fire.”
So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the nigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him with his knife, and fried him.
When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot. Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved. Then when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied. By-and-by Jim says:
“But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat ’uz killed in dat shanty ef it warn’t you?”
Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart. He said Tom Sawyer couldn’t get up no better plan than what I had. Then I says:
“How do you come to be here, Jim, and how’d you get here?”
He looked pretty uneasy, and didn’t say nothing for a minute. Then he says:
“Maybe I better not tell.”
“Why, Jim?”
“Well, dey’s reasons. But you wouldn’ tell on me ef I uz to tell you, would you, Huck?”
“Blamed if I would, Jim.”
“Well, I b’lieve you, Huck. I—I run off.”
“Jim!”
“But mind, you said you wouldn’ tell—you know you said you wouldn’ tell, Huck.”
“Well, I did. I said I wouldn’t, and I’ll stick to it. Honest injun, I will. People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for keeping mum—but that don’t make no difference. I ain’t a-going to tell, and I ain’t a-going back there, anyways. So, now, le’s know all about it.”
“Well, you see, it ’uz dis way. Ole missus—dat’s Miss Watson—she pecks on me all de time, en treats me pooty rough, but she awluz said she wouldn’ sell me down to Orleans. But I noticed dey wuz a nigger trader roun’ de place considable lately, en I begin to git oneasy. Well, one night I creeps to de do’ pooty late, en de do’ warn’t quite shet, en I hear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans, but she didn’ want to, but she could git eight hund’d dollars for me, en it ’uz sich a big stack o’ money she couldn’ resis’. De widder she try to git her to say she wouldn’ do it, but I never waited to hear de res’. I lit out mighty quick, I tell you.
“I tuck out en shin down de hill, en ’spec to steal a skift ’long de sho’ som’ers ’bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring yit, so I hid in de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to go ’way. Well, I wuz dah all night. Dey wuz somebody roun’ all de time. ’Long ’bout six in de mawnin’ skifts begin to go by, en ’bout eight er nine every skift dat went ’long wuz talkin’ ’bout how yo’ pap come over to de town en say you’s killed. Dese las’ skifts wuz full o’ ladies en genlmen a-goin’ over for to see de place. Sometimes dey’d pull up at de sho’ en take a res’ b’fo’ dey started acrost, so by de talk I got to know all ’bout de killin’. I ’uz powerful sorry you’s killed, Huck, but I ain’t no mo’ now.
“I laid dah under de shavin’s all day. I ’uz hungry, but I warn’t afeard; bekase I knowed ole missus en de widder wuz goin’ to start to de camp-meet’n’ right arter breakfas’ en be gone all day, en dey knows I goes off wid de cattle ’bout daylight, so dey wouldn’ ’spec to see me roun’ de place, en so dey wouldn’ miss me tell arter dark in de evenin’. De yuther servants wouldn’ miss me, kase dey’d shin out en take holiday soon as de ole folks ’uz out’n de way.
“Well, when it come dark I tuck out up de river road, en went ’bout two mile er more to whah dey warn’t no houses. I’d made up my mine ’bout what I’s agwyne to do. You see, ef I kep’ on tryin’ to git away afoot, de dogs ’ud track me; ef I stole a skift to cross over, dey’d miss dat skift, you see, en dey’d know ’bout whah I’d lan’ on de yuther side, en whah to pick up my track. So I says, a raff is what I’s arter; it doan’ make no track.
“I see a light a-comin’ roun’ de p’int bymeby, so I wade’ in en shove’ a log ahead o’ me en swum more’n half way acrost de river, en got in ’mongst de drift-wood, en kep’ my head down low, en kinder swum agin de current tell de raff come along. Den I swum to de stern uv it en tuck a-holt. It clouded up en ’uz pooty dark for a little while. So I clumb up en laid down on de planks. De men ’uz all ’way yonder in de middle, whah de lantern wuz. De river wuz a-risin’, en dey wuz a good current; so I reck’n’d ’at by fo’ in de mawnin’ I’d be twenty-five mile down de river, en den I’d slip in jis b’fo’ daylight en swim asho’, en take to de woods on de Illinois side.
“But I didn’ have no luck. When we ’uz mos’ down to de head er de islan’ a man begin to come aft wid de lantern, I see it warn’t no use fer to wait, so I slid overboard en struck out fer de islan’. Well, I had a notion I could lan’ mos’ anywhers, but I couldn’t—bank too bluff. I ’uz mos’ to de foot er de islan’ b’fo’ I found’ a good place. I went into de woods en jedged I wouldn’ fool wid raffs no mo’, long as dey move de lantern roun’ so. I had my pipe en a plug er dog-leg, en some matches in my cap, en dey warn’t wet, so I ’uz all right.”
“And so you ain’t had no meat nor bread to eat all this time? Why didn’t you get mud-turkles?”
“How you gwyne to git ’m? You can’t slip up on um en grab um; en how’s a body gwyne to hit um wid a rock? How could a body do it in de night? En I warn’t gwyne to show mysef on de bank in de daytime.”
“Well, that’s so. You’ve had to keep in the woods all the time, of course. Did you hear ’em shooting the cannon?”
“Oh, yes. I knowed dey was arter you. I see um go by heah—watched um thoo de bushes.”
Some young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and lighting. Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain. He said it was a sign when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the same way when young birds done it. I was going to catch some of them, but Jim wouldn’t let me. He said it was death. He said his father laid mighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old granny said his father would die, and he did.
And Jim said you mustn’t count the things you are going to cook for dinner, because that would bring bad luck. The same if you shook the table-cloth after sundown. And he said if a man owned a beehive and that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next morning, or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die. Jim said bees wouldn’t sting idiots; but I didn’t believe that, because I had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn’t sting me.
I had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them. Jim knowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything. I said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked him if there warn’t any good-luck signs. He says:
“Mighty few—an’ dey ain’t no use to a body. What you want to know when good luck’s a-comin’ for? Want to keep it off?” And he said: “Ef you’s got hairy arms en a hairy breas’, it’s a sign dat you’s agwyne to be rich. Well, dey’s some use in a sign like dat, ’kase it’s so fur ahead. You see, maybe you’s got to be po’ a long time fust, en so you might git discourage’ en kill yo’sef ’f you didn’ know by de sign dat you gwyne to be rich bymeby.”
“Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?”
“What’s de use to ax dat question? Don’t you see I has?”
“Well, are you rich?”
“No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin. Wunst I had foteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat’n’, en got busted out.”
“What did you speculate in, Jim?”
“Well, fust I tackled stock.”
“What kind of stock?”
“Why, live stock—cattle, you know. I put ten dollars in a cow. But I ain’ gwyne to resk no mo’ money in stock. De cow up ’n’ died on my han’s.”
“So you lost the ten dollars.”
“No, I didn’t lose it all. I on’y los’ ’bout nine of it. I sole de hide en taller for a dollar en ten cents.”

"I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn’t do it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking—thinking how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell. And went on thinking. And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I couldn’t seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the other kind. I’d see him standing my watch on top of his’n, ’stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the only one he’s got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.
It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was a-trembling, because I’d got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself:
“All right, then, I’ll go to hell”—and tore it up.
It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again, which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn’t. And for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again; and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.
Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that suited me. So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in. I slept the night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast, and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore. I landed below where I judged was Phelps’s place, and hid my bundle in the woods, and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.
Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it, “Phelps’s Sawmill,” and when I come to the farm-houses, two or three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn’t see nobody around, though it was good daylight now. But I didn’t mind, because I didn’t want to see nobody just yet—I only wanted to get the lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from the village, not from below. So I just took a look, and shoved along, straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was the duke. He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch—three-night performance—like that other time. They had the cheek, them frauds! I was right on him before I could shirk. He looked astonished, and says:
“Hel-lo! Where’d you come from?” Then he says, kind of glad and eager, “Where’s the raft?—got her in a good place?”
I says:
“Why, that’s just what I was going to ask your grace.”
Then he didn’t look so joyful, and says:
“What was your idea for asking me?” he says.
“Well,” I says, “when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says to myself, we can’t get him home for hours, till he’s soberer; so I went a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait. A man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat, and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after him. We didn’t have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out. We never got him till dark; then we fetched him over, and I started down for the raft. When I got there and see it was gone, I says to myself, ‘they’ve got into trouble and had to leave; and they’ve took my nigger, which is the only nigger I’ve got in the world, and now I’m in a strange country, and ain’t got no property no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;’ so I set down and cried.

“I wouldn’t shake my nigger, would I?—the only nigger I had in the world, and the only property.”
“We never thought of that. Fact is, I reckon we’d come to consider him our nigger; yes, we did consider him so—goodness knows we had trouble enough for him. So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke, there warn’t anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another shake. And I’ve pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn.

“We never thought of that. Fact is, I reckon we’d come to consider him our nigger; yes, we did consider him so—goodness knows we had trouble enough for him. So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke, there warn’t anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another shake. And I’ve pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn. Where’s that ten cents? Give it here.”",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"In this passage, the protagonist reflects on his moral dilemma and memories with Jim, a runaway slave. Torn between turning Jim in and freeing him, he decides to help Jim escape, even if it means going to hell. The protagonist then plans and sets out to rescue Jim. Upon reaching the town, he encounters the duke and fabricates a story to explain his actions and inquire about Jim's whereabouts. The duke reveals that the raft is gone, and the king squandered their money. They assume the protagonist stole the raft and ran off, leaving them to reopen their fraudulent show.",1188
"DON'T you like getting presents? I do. Birthdays and Christmas are always enjoyable times. We love receiving surprise presents. I remember visiting a house in the country once, and a little boy and girl of the house came into my room when my luggage was being unpacked, and eyed everything being taken out of my bag and boxes with the greatest interest. At last they could keep silent no longer.
""And what have you brought us?"" they asked.
I was filled with confusion, for I had brought them nothing. I had not known of their existence. Their expectations were disappointed.
Another little boy of my acquaintance came to lunch with me one day. His mother was with him, and I think had talked to him beforehand about being on his best behaviour. I had got a toy for him to amuse himself with, and he had a very good time after lunch playing with it.
When he was going away, I told him he could take it with him. ""I'll make you a present of it,"" I said.
To my surprise, he put his hands behind his back, and said, ""Oh, no, thank you.""
""Don't you want it?"" I asked.
He shook his head, though he eyed it lovingly.
""I assure you, your mother will like you to have it,"" I said.
But nothing would induce him to take it, and he went away without it.
I fancy he was trying to be extra good. He thought it was not good manners to take a present away.
""What a silly boy!"" you say.
But we often act like that with God. And it is such a pity, for we lose so much by not stretching out our hands to take what He offers us.
We may have a present offered us, but if we won't put out our hands to take it, what is the good of it to us? And how ungrateful to the kind giver!
Sometimes people get unsuitable presents. I heard of a little girl who bought a tiny doll's tea-set, and gave it to her mother as a birthday present.
And a scholarly old bachelor uncle gave his little nephew on his seventh birthday a Latin book, ""Virgil's Aeneid.""
We can fancy that neither of these presents was suitable!
Now God knows exactly what we want, and He gives us everything suitable to our age and circumstances. But there is one gift that is wanted by everybody, big and small, rich and poor. Many of the gifts we get in this world, wear out, and come to an end; this one cannot come to an end. And it is the gift that God likes to give us.
Some presents cost a lot of money. This one cost Somebody His life to get, and that makes it the most valuable gift in the whole world.
In the time of slavery, there was an old negro woman who had a son whom she loved very dearly. She and he lived and worked on a sugar plantation in the West Indies, for they were both slaves. But at that time some of the slave owners would allow their slaves to purchase their freedom, and though it cost them a great deal of money, some freed themselves in this way. It was this old woman's one desire in life to work overtime, save her money, and free her son from bondage.
She did not tell him what she was doing but she worked when he was asleep—and never took any rest or holiday herself. The consequence was, she ruined her health, and after many years of this dreadfully hard laborious life, she broke down, and had to take to her bed. But by that time she had earned the money to buy the freedom of her son. She called him one night to her dying bed, and produced a canvas bag.
""Here,"" she said, ""is money to set you free, my son. You will never be a slave any more. I have worked all my life to get it, and now I have got the money, I die in peace.""
She died in her son's arms—and he felt that his freedom had cost his mother her life.
Now the gift that God offers to us all cost the Lord Jesus Christ His life, and it is only through Him—or because of Him that we can get it.

""The Gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.""

Is not Eternal Life a tremendous gift to be offered to us? Yet we can all have it. Every one of us—great and small—rich and poor. And if we know we have it, death will not make us afraid. Our souls cannot die. Eternal life with our Saviour in Heaven. That Land of Happiness which is too glorious to be described. Who would not stretch out their hands for such a gift?
But it needs empty hands to take it. We must let everything else go, and we must take the Lord Jesus Christ for our own Saviour. It is only for His sake, and through Him, that God gives us this gift.
Take it from Him now. Thank Him with all your hearts for giving it to you, and serve Him and love Him for the rest of your lives. That is how you can show your gratitude for such a gift as this.
It is the biggest gift you could have offered to you.",中国的饮食文化丰富多彩，各地的人们形成了独特的饮食习惯和口味偏好。比如，对于山西人来说，醋是一种不可或缺的调味料。山西的醋不仅仅是一种调料，更是一种文化。在山西的街头巷尾，你总能闻到那扑鼻而来的醋香。无论是炒菜、炖菜，还是凉拌菜，他们总会加入一勺醋来提味，特别是用醋腌制的酸菜，是山西人最爱的下饭菜之一。酸香四溢的酸菜，不仅能激发人的食欲，还能起到开胃消食的作用。山西人对于醋的热爱，可以说是深入骨髓的，甚至在许多家庭的饭桌上，会看到一瓶专门的醋放在旁边，随时可以添加到饭菜中去。生活在辽宁的人则偏爱酸菜白肉火锅。尤是在寒冷的冬季，围在一起吃一锅热腾腾的酸菜白肉火锅，成为了一家人的温暖时刻。酸菜的酸爽和白肉的肥美相得益彰，汤底还可以加入一些海鲜，丰富的口感让人拍手称绝。北京人的饮食习惯也非常独特，他们喜欢酸菜汤，但与其他地方不同的是，北京人的酸菜汤多以羊肉为主料。酸酸的汤配上鲜嫩的羊肉，再加入一些杂面，这种吃法在一个寒冷的冬夜尤其受欢迎，既暖胃又暖心。有趣的是，福建和广西人则对酸笋情有独钟。酸笋是将竹笋发酵而成的一种食材，味道辛辣酸爽，当地人喜欢用它来做酸笋汤或炖菜。在傣族地区，酸笋炖鸡是一道非常传统的美食。酸笋的酸味可以去除鸡肉的腥味，同时还能增添菜肴的风味。除了对酸味的偏爱，延庆山里的居民在夏天还喜欢吃一种叫做酸饭的食物。这种饭是将糯米饭发酵至微酸，然后搭配一些时令蔬菜和腊肉，口感独特。据说，吃酸饭不仅能增加食欲，还是一种传统的避暑方式。不只是酸味，各地的甜食文化也是中国饮食的一大特色。无锡和广东的甜食尤其著名。无锡的糖醋排骨、糖芋头等菜品糖味十足，而广东的甜品如双皮奶、糖水更是远近闻名。值得一提的是，北京的饮食习惯这些年来似乎也发生了变化。过去，人们喜欢吃重口味的酸菜、羊肉汤，而现在，随着健康观念的普及，越来越多的人开始选择清淡、健康的饮食方式。比如，春天的时候，北京人会去采摘苣荬菜，这种野菜不仅营养丰富，还具有清肝明目的功效。贵州人的饮食习惯也非常特别，他们喜欢吃鱼腥草。这种草不仅有独特的腥味，还有清热解毒的功效。据说，贵州人能把鱼腥草做出各种美味的菜品，从炒菜到凉拌，无所不能。有趣的是，在一个剧团里，有一个干部非常喜欢吃辣椒。无论是在剧团的食堂，还是在外出表演的路上，他总会随身携带一小瓶辣椒酱。每当大家在一起吃饭时，他总会打开瓶盖，将辣椒酱洒在菜肴上，然后津津有味地品尝。对他而言，辣椒不仅是一种调味料，更是一种生活情趣和追求。总的来说，中国人对于饮食的热爱不仅体现在对食材和口味的执着上，还融入了特定的风土人情和文化习惯。这些独特的饮食偏好，构成了中国饮食文化的丰富多样性。,易,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"The passage discusses the joy and expectations associated with receiving presents, emphasizing the importance of accepting and appreciating gifts.

"In the year 1653 there come sad news to Ellswether. My Lord Brandon, heading a rising for the young king in the North, was taken and beheaded; and my lady his wife, who had wearied herself in vain to obtain his pardon, died after giving birth to a daughter. Their son and heir had died in his infancy, and the barony must needs descend to a distant cousin of my lord’s, that was a boon companion of the king in France and Flanders. My lord’s estates and property was all confiscated, and for the poor babe was nothing left, save that she might have my lady’s gowns and suchlike. My lady had committed her babe to the charge of the gentlewoman that bare her company, desiring that she should be brought to Ellswether, and bred up by my mother. Wherefore this gentlewoman, Mrs Sophronia Skipwith by name, took with her the babe, together with my lady’s gowns and jewels, and the great portraits of her and my lord which he had had painted for her on their wedding, and divers tomes of French and English romances, and started on her journey. Coming to Ellswether, she found there sore lamentation, for that my dear mother had departed this life two days before. And Sir Harry, my father, finding himself with my Lady Brandon’s babe to keep, and discerning Mrs Skipwith to be a gentlewoman of most discreet conversation and a sobriety suiting her years (which were thirty-five at the least, and rather over than under), did offer her to remain as governess to the babe, the rather as the aforesaid Mrs Skipwith was an orphan and a distant kinswoman of my lady’s. Now if you look to hear that Mrs Skipwith made use of Sir Harry’s kindness to creep into his good graces, and thus marry him thereafter, you shall be disappointed, for she behaved herself throughout her life with a rare discreetness and wisdom, and hath left behind her a memory full of praise.
My good father, then, adopted for his own the little Mrs Dorothy Brandon (whose kinsman, even after the happy Restoration of his majesty King Charles II., when he gat back his lands, never troubled himself to inquire after her, lest for very shame he must settle on her a portion out of the estates of my lord her father), my father, I say, adopted her, intending in due time to marry her to me his son, and we grew up together as brother and sister, but in that prospect. Now at the Restoration, as I have said, there was many received back their confiscated lands, but my father, who (with his brothers) had sold and mortgaged all for the king’s service, gat nothing, since he had done it all willingly. There remained to us, then, only the manor of Ellswether itself, whereon was a heavy mortgage, that was fallen into the hands of Mr Sternhold, the attorney that my grandfather had been wont to employ. And again, if you look to hear in this place that Mr Sternhold proved himself a cruel or an unrighteous creditor, you will again receive a disappointment, for sure there was never no man that served better either the father or the absent son. But if this great burden of the mortgage was to be removed, it was needful for me to make my fortune, and this in no unspeedy way. And if you shall be surprised that my father allowed me, his only son, to undertake such a distant and dangerous manner of life as that I have followed, I would have you remember that Sir Harry, as was but natural in a gentleman of his family and breeding, cared more for the honour and name of the house than for him that might one day bear it, and that he sent me forth in quest of wealth for to redeem the estates, as any father in Rome might have sent forth his son in quest of warlike honour. After this explanation, which I trust shall resolve any matters that might otherwise seem to you obscure or contradictory, I will proceed to my tale.
Since I have spoke to you of my father’s poverty, you will readily perceive that he could not send me to any great school, nor was he likely, in the dark days that then shadowed this poor realm of ours, to commit me to the tuition of the schismatical minister that had usurped the room of the vicar of our parish, wherefore he was constrained to send me by the day to the grammar-school of Puckle Acton, which town lieth in the vicinage of Ellswether. Here, in common with the sons of many gentlemen of the country round, I gained a slight acquaintance with Greek and Latin, and (for which my life hath made me far more grateful) such a knowledge of the art of fence, of boxing and shooting, as hath often stood me in good stead. When I was not at the school, the time did often hang heavy for me, for the gentlemen’s sons of whom I have spoken durst not admit me to their company more than rarely, for fear of the suspicions of our tyrants, that were wont to scent a conjuration or conspiracy whensoever any number of Malignants (for so they called us) was met together. The company of the boys of the town I neither sought nor would my father have permitted me so to do, and I came thus, almost of necessity, to use and enjoy that of my little cousin Dorothy Brandon, in all my holidays and times of rest. ’Twas with her I learned from Mrs Skipwith to read French, and we loved to pore together over the pages of the ‘Grand Cyrus,’ that magazine of brave thoughts and witty conceits, of the ‘Cleopâtre’ and of the ‘Clélie.’ Of English books we had no great store, but in Sir Philip Sidney his ‘Arcadia’ and in Mr Lyly’s ‘Euphues’ we found a rare delight. Add to this, that my little cousin taught herself Latin in order to the reading it with me, and (her youth remembered) was no mean scholar in the Greek, and you shall see that we had no lack of fantastic and heroical reading for to divert ourselves withal.","中国是一个拥有悠久饮食文化和丰富地理环境的国度，不同地区的人们因地理条件、气候和历史习惯，形成了各具特色的饮食习惯和口味偏好。细究起来，这不仅仅是个人选择的问题，更是文化传承和地域特色的最好体现。本文将带你走遍中国大地，揭秘各地的饮食习惯和口味偏好，领略中国美食的博大精深。

山西，作为一个植根于黄土高原的省份，以独特的醋文化闻名于世。这里的每一道菜几乎都离不开醋，酸菜更是山西人饭桌上的常客。无论是酸菜炒肉，还是酸菜炖粉条，都充满了浓郁的地方风味。山西的醋有一种特别的香味，清爽开胃，被誉为“山西老陈醋”的经典品牌更是家喻户晓。

前往东北的辽宁，酸菜白肉火锅是人们冬天围炉夜话的美食选择。这道菜讲究用东北特有的酸菜炖煮，配上鲜嫩的猪肉片，再佐以葱姜蒜调料，味道鲜美，暖身暖心。毋庸置疑，酸菜在辽宁饮食中占据着不可替代的位置，带给人们无尽的味蕾享受。

北京的独特之处在于其饮食习惯的多样化。虽然传统的羊肉酸菜汤和杂面仍深得人心，但现代北京人的饮食习惯在快速城市化的进程中也发生了显著变化。越来越多的人开始注重健康饮食，选择清淡、低脂的菜肴。尽管如此，经典的羊肉酸菜汤和杂面依然是冬日里的温暖慰藉。

在南方的福建和广西，酸笋是当地人餐桌上的常见食材。酸笋的酸味带有独特的清香，融合于各种菜肴中，成为一道道口感丰富的佳肴。傣族人更是将酸笋烹饪艺术发挥到极致，他们喜欢用酸笋炖鸡，鸡肉鲜嫩多汁，配上酸笋的独特味道，让人食指大动。

夏天的延庆山里，酸饭则是乡村餐桌上的一道风味独特的主食。它以米饭发酵制成，口感酸爽，可以开胃消暑，是当地炎热夏季里的一道必备美食。

无锡和广东作为南方的代表，甜食文化在这里得到了充分的发展。无锡的糖醋排骨和桂花糕甜而不腻，入口即化；广东的各种甜品更是令人垂涎欲滴，双皮奶、杨枝甘露等甜品甜美舒心，让人难以抗拒。

北方人的春天离不开苣荬菜。苣荬菜是北方春季的时令野菜，清香爽口，可以凉拌、炒制或者做成馅料。它不仅是北方人喜爱的美食，更是一种对春天的礼赞与感恩。

贵州的独特饮食文化体现在对鱼腥草的偏爱上。鱼腥草具有特别的腥香味，这种味道虽然很多外地人难以接受，但在贵州人的餐桌上，鱼腥草无论是凉拌、煲汤，还是入菜，都是不可或缺的一部分。

剧团里的那个干部，则是四川辣椒的忠实爱好者。在他的点燃之下，剧团的伙食也常常辣气腾腾。辣椒不仅让菜品更加美味，还能激发食欲，驱寒暖胃，是剧团人日常生活中喜爱的调味品。

每一道菜，每一种调料，背后都有一段流传千年的故事和情感。这些不同地域的饮食文化，正是中国文化多样性和丰富性的体现。无论你身处何地，总有一种属于你家乡的味道，带给你温暖和回忆。",易,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"In 1653, Lord Brandon was executed for supporting the young king, and his wife died after childbirth, leaving their baby daughter Dorothy orphaned.

After this explanation, which I trust shall resolve any matters that might otherwise seem to you obscure or contradictory, I will proceed to my tale.
Since I have spoke to you of my father’s poverty, you will readily perceive that he could not send me to any great school, nor was he likely, in the dark days that then shadowed this poor realm of ours, to commit me to the tuition of the schismatical minister that had usurped the room of the vicar of our parish, wherefore he was constrained to send me by the day to the grammar-school of Puckle Acton, which town lieth in the vicinage of Ellswether. Here, in common with the sons of many gentlemen of the country round, I gained a slight acquaintance with Greek and Latin, and (for which my life hath made me far more grateful) such a knowledge of the art of fence, of boxing and shooting, as hath often stood me in good stead. When I was not at the school, the time did often hang heavy for me, for the gentlemen’s sons of whom I have spoken durst not admit me to their company more than rarely, for fear of the suspicions of our tyrants, that were wont to scent a conjuration or conspiracy whensoever any number of Malignants (for so they called us) was met together. The company of the boys of the town I neither sought nor would my father have permitted me so to do, and I came thus, almost of necessity, to use and enjoy that of my little cousin Dorothy Brandon, in all my holidays and times of rest. ’Twas with her I learned from Mrs Skipwith to read French, and we loved to pore together over the pages of the ‘Grand Cyrus,’ that magazine of brave thoughts and witty conceits, of the ‘Cleopâtre’ and of the ‘Clélie.’ Of English books we had no great store, but in Sir Philip Sidney his ‘Arcadia’ and in Mr Lyly’s ‘Euphues’ we found a rare delight. Add to this, that my little cousin taught herself Latin in order to the reading it with me, and (her youth remembered) was no mean scholar in the Greek, and you shall see that we had no lack of fantastic and heroical reading for to divert ourselves withal.",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"In 1653, Lord Brandon was executed for supporting the young king, and his wife died after childbirth, leaving their baby daughter Dorothy orphaned.

"In the year 1655 there come sad news to Ellswether. My Lord Brandon, heading a rising for the young king in the North, was taken and beheaded; and my lady his wife, who had wearied herself in vain to obtain his pardon, died after giving birth to a daughter. Their son and heir had died in his infancy, and the barony must needs descend to a distant cousin of my lord’s, that was a boon companion of the king in France and Flanders. My lord’s estates and property was all confiscated, and for the poor babe was nothing left, save that she might have my lady’s gowns and suchlike. My lady had committed her babe to the charge of the gentlewoman that bare her company, desiring that she should be brought to Ellswether, and bred up by my mother. Wherefore this gentlewoman, Mrs Sophronia Skipwith by name, took with her the babe, together with my lady’s gowns and jewels, and the great portraits of her and my lord which he had had painted for her on their wedding, and divers tomes of French and English romances, and started on her journey. Coming to Ellswether, she found there sore lamentation, for that my dear mother had departed this life two days before. And Sir Harry, my father, finding himself with my Lady Brandon’s babe to keep, and discerning Mrs Skipwith to be a gentlewoman of most discreet conversation and a sobriety suiting her years (which were thirty-five at the least, and rather over than under), did offer her to remain as governess to the babe, the rather as the aforesaid Mrs Skipwith was an orphan and a distant kinswoman of my lady’s. Now if you look to hear that Mrs Skipwith made use of Sir Harry’s kindness to creep into his good graces, and thus marry him thereafter, you shall be disappointed, for she behaved herself throughout her life with a rare discreetness and wisdom, and hath left behind her a memory full of praise.
My good father, then, adopted for his own the little Mrs Dorothy Brandon (whose kinsman, even after the happy Restoration of his majesty King Charles II., when he gat back his lands, never troubled himself to inquire after her, lest for very shame he must settle on her a portion out of the estates of my lord her father), my father, I say, adopted her, intending in due time to marry her to me his son, and we grew up together as brother and sister, but in that prospect. Now at the Restoration, as I have said, there was many received back their confiscated lands, but my father, who (with his brothers) had sold and mortgaged all for the king’s service, gat nothing, since he had done it all willingly. There remained to us, then, only the manor of Ellswether itself, whereon was a heavy mortgage, that was fallen into the hands of Mr Sternhold, the attorney that my grandfather had been wont to employ. And again, if you look to hear in this place that Mr Sternhold proved himself a cruel or an unrighteous creditor, you will again receive a disappointment, for sure there was never no man that served better either the father or the absent son. But if this great burden of the mortgage was to be removed, it was needful for me to make my fortune, and this in no unspeedy way. And if you shall be surprised that my father allowed me, his only son, to undertake such a distant and dangerous manner of life as that I have followed, I would have you remember that Sir Harry, as was but natural in a gentleman of his family and breeding, cared more for the honour and name of the house than for him that might one day bear it, and that he sent me forth in quest of wealth for to redeem the estates, as any father in Rome might have sent forth his son in quest of warlike honour.

"We could see Jacobsdal from the Weltufrede farm, a few buildings on the banks of a brook, and a neat little church, being all that this embryo town of the western Transvaal had then to show. After leaving it we turned north, then north-east towards Zeerust, the most important settlement in the[22] Marico district. On our way thither we passed one of the most productive farms in the neighbourhood; it belonged to a man named Bootha, and was traversed by the Malmani, which wound its way through a low rocky ridge to its junction with the Marico.
I made a preliminary visit by myself to the little town, but we did not actually move our quarters into Zeerust till next day. It covers a larger area than Jacobsdal, and any one devoted to natural science would find abundant material to interest him in its vicinity. We, however, only remained there a few hours, and started off for Linokana, outside which we encountered Mr. Jensen, who was bringing the mail-bag from the interior. The missionary received us with the utmost cordiality, and gave us an invitation, which I accepted most gratefully, to stay with him for a fortnight; the time that I spent with him was beneficial in more ways than one, as not only did it afford me an opportunity of thoroughly exploring the neighbourhood, but it permitted my companions to enjoy a rest which already they much required.
In 1875, the Baharutse in Linokana gathered in as much as 800 sacks of wheat, each containing 200 lbs., and every year a wider area of land is being brought under cultivation. Besides wheat, they grow maize, sorghum, melons, and tobacco, selling what they do not require for their own consumption in the markets of the Transvaal and the diamond-fields; it cannot be said, however, that their fields are as carefully kept as those of the Barolongs. A great deal of their land has been transferred to the Boer government, and they only retain the ownership of a few farms.

On the 9th I went to the sources of the Matebe and wandered about the surrounding hills, where mineral ores seem to abound. The following day I employed myself in drawing out a sketch-map of my route, and when I had completed it, I amused myself by an inspection of the plantations and gardens which surround the mission-station. I attended the chapel, where the service consisted of a hymn, the reading of a portion of one of the gospels, then another hymn, followed by a sermon; the impression made upon the congregation as they squatted on their low wooden stools being very marked, and the whole service in its very simplicity being to my mind as solemn as the most gorgeous ritual.
The native postman from Molopolole arrived late on the evening of the 15th, the journey having taken him three days; he only stayed one night, and started back again with the European mail that came through Zeerust from Klerksdorf. To my great surprise it brought me a kind letter from Dr. A. Petermann, the renowned geographer at Gotha.
An English major likewise arrived from the Banguaketse countries; he was in search of ore and was now on his way to Kolobeng and Molopolole; he gave us an interesting account of the reasons that had induced him and Captain Finlayson to explore the north-eastern Transvaal.
The Baharutse girls seem to be particularly fond of dancing, and we hardly ever failed of an evening to hear music and occasionally singing in various parts of the town.
One of the most picturesque spots in the whole[24] neighbourhood is in the valley of the Notuany, about three miles below its confluence with the Matebe; it is enclosed by rocky slopes broken here and there by rich glens and luxuriant woodlands that afford cover for countless birds, whilst in the sedge-thickets on the Matebe wild cats nearly as large as leopards lurk about for their prey.","当第一缕晨曦刚刚划破东方的天际，山西汾河岸边的小巷里已弥漫着浓浓的醋香。山西人喜酸，无论是酸菜还是陈年老醋，都已融入他们的骨血。从薄荷叶般的酸菜汤到醋泡大蒜，酸味在山西人的餐桌上，是不可或缺的主角。去过山西的人，经常会被一道道与醋有关的美食所惊艳，令人回味无穷。

南方的无锡和广东，另一番天地则展现了甜食的魅力。不同于北方的酸味和热气腾腾的火锅，无锡的甜食糯而不腻，适合饭后细细品味，白兔奶糖、小笼包、桂花糖藕……无不散发着江南水乡的雅致。而广东的甜汤，早茶里的一盅两件，恍如梦中的味道，在甜美里让一天的疲倦烟消云散。

北京的饮食习惯也在变化，如今更多的年轻人钟情于外来美食，但那深藏在记忆里的炸酱面、卤煮火烧，依旧是绕不过去的乡愁。在春天里，北方人还会食用苣荬菜，这种野生菜不仅仅是为了口味的清新，更是一种对大地春回的庆祝。

而在西南的贵州，鱼腥草是一道独特的美味，无论是凉拌、炒菜还是火锅，鱼腥草的味道总能唤起人们对乡土食材的热爱。剧团里的一个干部特爱吃辣椒，无论是辣椒炒肉还是剁椒鱼头，辛辣刺激的味觉挑战使他在紧张的工作间隙找到一种独特的放松方式。生活在这个剧组里，就像被浓烈的香料围绕，时刻充盈着浓墨重彩的激情。

中国广袤的土地和多元的民族文化，使得不同地域的饮食习惯都带有浓厚的地方特色。从北国的寒酸到南方的甜美，酸、甜、辛辣在这片土地上交相辉映。饮食是文化的镜子，这一碗碗、美食就像一个个韵味十足的故事，讲述着中国各地的风土人情与生活态度。",易,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"The passage describes a journey through parts of the western Transvaal, including Jacobsdal, Zeerust, Linokana, and surrounding areas.

"Dr. Rawlings sighed a long sigh born of frustration and impatience and went wearily to the bookcase. Almost methodically he removed a large gold-titled volume of Freud's A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis and withdrew the bottle from its hiding place. The bottle was half filled with an amber fluid which jiggled pleasantly as he held it in an unsteady hand, observing with a practiced eye how gaily it sparkled in the late afternoon sunlight. Then from the cavity he also extracted a small whiskey glass.
He took these tools to his desk, poured himself a stiff one, downed it, flopped into his swivel chair and closed his eyes. Chicken farms, he thought. He felt the fiery liquid seep through him, warming his insides with its silent flame, bringing a pleasant glow of satisfaction to his mind.
He closed his eyes tighter and regarded the darkened world with a calmness that was somehow conducive to rational thought even in this irrational world. To thought and to sleep, he realized suddenly, as he found his head tilting.
He rose quickly, blinking off the effects of the liquor, and carefully returned the utensils to their proper niche behind the volume of Freud on the bookshelf. Good old Freud, he thought, always knew he'd come in handy one of these days. Then he returned to his desk to consult a small pad, and silently cursed the cruel fates that had given him patients tumbling upon one another in a ridiculously mad haste to reach the jumbled sanity of the normal world.
Why couldn't there have been a decent interval of time between them, so he could take a shower, or have a game of golf, or maybe even hang on a small one, or see a psychiatrist himself. Or maybe start that chicken farm he'd been talking about for the past two years.
He jabbed a button, said into the intercom, ""Miss Austin, will you please send in the file on Mr. Charles T. Moore?""—and without waiting for an answer snapped the machine off.
Fifteen seconds later the door opened and Miss Austin walked in, a Manila folder in one lovely hand. As usual she was in an immaculately white uniform. White for purity? he wondered. It was a tight-fitting garment that clung to every curve as though hanging on for dear life, and on second thought he mentally erased the purity inscription on his mind's slate.
Miss Austin had a beautiful walk, and beautiful legs to walk on. He stared at them as she approached the desk. He always stared at them, fascinated, and she always knew he did, and she smiled that enticingly mad smile of hers that always made him want to give vent to an emotional catharsis.
God, he thought, how I'd love to psychoanalyze that woman! What a beautiful ego she must have. What a gorgeous id.
Carefully she deposited the folder on his desk, leaning forward strategically so her perfume could glide over him in intoxicating currents.
""Will that be all, Doctor Rawlings?"" she asked in her honey-liquid tones.
""For now,"" he said, reaching for her hand and finding it. ""But don't go away.""
She smiled again, and gently freeing her hand, swept from the room. She looked even better from the back, if that were possible; after a few seconds deliberation he decided it wasn't possible. But it was women like Miss Austin that made him want a chicken farm, among other things. Miss Austin and a little tract of land far out in the country would be just perfect. In such a paradise he wouldn't even have to worry about the pecking order of hens. In fact, he might even get engrossed in raising things other than chickens.
Sighing again, he studied the folder before him, which did not take very long. The patient was still quite young even though he had already made a mark of sorts on the world. A theoretical mathematician, apparently. Probably thought himself a square circle on an adding machine. The psychiatrist browsed through the folder's contents again, then jabbed the buzzer.
""You can send Mr. Moore in now,"" he said and snapped the intercom off before Miss Austin could answer. The present moment was no time to be distracted.
Dr. Rawlings held his head in his hands and stared morosely at the desk. Then he picked up a pencil and began tapping it against an inkwell. An incongruous thought surely, pencil and inkwell—what would Freud say about that?
He decided in the same thought that he didn't give a particular damn what Freud thought about inkwells. There were times in fact when he didn't care what Freud thought about anything. There were times when all we wanted to think about was a small chicken farm, with maybe a gorgeous honey-blonde like Miss Austin to help sow a few seeds.
He looked out the window at the sky and the tops of buildings, and recalled with bitterness the patient who had claimed that he could fly, and who had tried to jump to the street forty floors below solely to prove it. It would have made a nasty splash, he thought. All the king's horses and all the king's men—Unless, of course, the patient really could fly....
He looked up, annoyed, and discovered that the door had not opened. Furiously, he jabbed the buzzer again. ""Isn't Mr. Moore here yet?"" he demanded, consulting his watch. ""He was supposed to be here five minutes ago.""
""He's here, Doctor,"" the receptionist's silk-and-satin tones came. ""He's trying to get up enough courage to open the door.""
""Oh,"" the psychiatrist said. He felt like adding something unprofessional, but he controlled himself. With an effort he shut off the intercom and just waited.
He looked up at the door and saw the knob turning slowly, ever so slowly. He watched its glistening facets turn in the dim natural lighting of the room, rotating as though in the slowest of slow motions.
He sighed and turned his attention to his desk top, where he discovered he had abstractedly pencilled on the blotter a four letter word not normally used in polite society. Hastily, annoyed with himself, he grabbed the pencil and used its erasing head to rub off the offending word.
When he looked up again, the door had opened the slightest crack. Damn, he thought, this job is going to drive me whacky yet. He recalled an episode of a few weeks earlier. He didn't want to, but the thought came just the same. Some of his patients had delusions so logical and systematized it was hard to prove to them that they were wrong. Sometimes it was hard to prove to yourself they were not right after all.
The woman from Mars, for example. She had actually believed that she was from the fourth planet, was really a Martian stranded here unaccountably. She had told a good straight story, but he had managed to convince her that she was not from Mars. He had persuaded her that she was an Earthling like everybody else, and that space travel of any sort was utterly impossible anyway.
He had been about to prove that there was probably no such planet as Mars when she'd decided not to come back. That was close to the time the meteorite landed a few miles away, the one that had never been found. After all, while not a usual occurrence, over-developed lungs and six fingers on each hand didn't mean—
The door edged open slightly, and an eye peered fearfully into the room. Then it swung wide, and the young man standing in the doorway let out a blastfurnace sigh that could be heard in surrounding offices.
""Come in, Mr. Moore,"" the psychiatrist said, ""come in, close the door, sit down.""
Mr. Moore did all these things with normal speed and in the proper order, but he did have a tendency to sit on the edge of his chair, as though he were sitting on a cliff and might topple over at any moment. The psychiatrist doodled on his pad impatiently.
""Well now, just what seems to be the trouble?""
Mr. Moore wet his lips. His face was white. He said, ""I'm a mathematician. I work at the University.""
""Oh,"" the other said, bringing to voice facts he'd read a few minutes before. ""You're that Charles T. Moore, the one whose picture was in the paper a short time ago. Something about mathematics, I remember.""
Moore nodded.
""Einstein, wasn't it?"" the psychiatrist mused. ""Something I don't understand, Einstein.""
""It's not easy,"" Moore agreed. ""That's what started my difficulty.""",在广袤的中国大地上，各地人们的饮食习惯和口味偏好各具特色，有着浓郁的地方风情。踏上黄土高原，来到山西的小巷深处，你定会闻到令人垂涎的醋香扑鼻而来。山西人对于醋的热爱可谓深入骨髓，几乎无所不用其极。无论是小吃摊上的凉粉，还是家常炖菜中的肉片，他们总喜欢点上一勺老陈醋，让这道菜的味道瞬间层次丰富。在冬日里，他们又出动家中的大缸，腌上满满一缸的酸菜。酸菜炖肉、热汤浇油泼辣子，酸辣适口，温暖身心。离开山西，我们一路北上，来到白雪皑皑的辽东平原。这里的居民一年四季都离不开酸菜，尤其是在寒冷的冬季，一锅酸菜白肉火锅无疑是驱寒取暖的绝佳之选。酸菜温中益气，白肉肥而不腻，一口热锅下肚，满身都沐浴在饱足与温馨中。 而在京城，老北京们则有着一种与众不同的酸菜情结。转过街角的卤煮店，你会发现一碗酸菜羊肉汤，那特有的酸香扑鼻，令人食欲大开。细腻的羊肉与酸菜交织成一种独特的风味，让人每每回味无穷。除此之外，杂面也是北京人家中的常客，各种粗粮细做的面食让他们既能够享受口感的满足，又能够兼顾健康。 若是逐渐南下，踏入福建和广西的地界，你会发现酸笋成了餐桌上的主角。酸笋爽脆可口，带有天然的酸味，无论是凉拌还是炖煮，都体现出原汁原味的美味。尤其在傣族人中，酸笋炖鸡是一道令人垂涎三尺的佳肴。鸡肉的鲜嫩与酸笋带来的清爽酸味相结合，让这道菜呈现出南方特有的灵动与清新。跨过南岭，来到温润的岭南，无锡与广东则以其独特的甜食文化而著称。无锡的小巷里，酒酿圆子和糯米糍是常见的甜品，而在广东的茶楼中，各式各样的点心美不胜收。这里的甜食不单是味蕾的享受，更是一种生活态度的体现，甜甜的幸福感渗透在日常生活的每个细节。北京人的饮食习惯也在岁月的流转中悄然发生变化。过去的素面清粥，已经无法满足如今的多样化需求，现代的北京人在兼顾传统的同时，也融入了更多异地的美味，从日式拉面到法式甜点，餐桌上的色彩更加丰富多元。随之而来的北方春天，则是苣荬菜的最好时节。在广袤的田野上，苣荬菜迎风生长，农家人辛勤地采摘，将鲜嫩的苣荬菜做成凉拌菜或者清炒，成为春日餐桌上一抹鲜绿。 而在山川环绕的贵州，人们独爱鱼儿身上的那股腥草味道。鱼腥草，这种独特的调料，赋予了贵州菜肴一种别致的辛香。无论是凉拌鱼腥草，还是用它烹制的酸汤鱼，扑鼻的腥香总让人食指大动。在剧团里，一个干部甚至有每天吃辣椒的习惯，无论是新鲜辣椒还是干辣椒，都是他的心头好。有人说，辣椒是他工作的动力，是他忙碌生活中的一丝快乐。,易,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"Dr. Rawlings, a weary and frustrated psychiatrist, indulges in a hidden stash of whiskey to cope with his demanding job and turbulent thoughts whenever he can.

"Dr. Rawlings sighed a long sigh born of frustration and impatience and went wearily to the bookcase. Almost methodically he removed a large gold-titled volume of Freud's A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis and withdrew the bottle from its hiding place. The bottle was half filled with an amber fluid which jiggled pleasantly as he held it in an unsteady hand, observing with a practiced eye how gaily it sparkled in the late afternoon sunlight. Then from the cavity he also extracted a small whiskey glass.
He took these tools to his desk, poured himself a stiff one, downed it, flopped into his swivel chair and closed his eyes. Chicken farms, he thought. He felt the fiery liquid seep through him, warming his insides with its silent flame, bringing a pleasant glow of satisfaction to his mind.
He closed his eyes tighter and regarded the darkened world with a calmness that was somehow conducive to rational thought even in this irrational world. To thought and to sleep, he realized suddenly, as he found his head tilting.
He rose quickly, blinking off the effects of the liquor, and carefully returned the utensils to their proper niche behind the volume of Freud on the bookshelf. Good old Freud, he thought, always knew he'd come in handy one of these days. Then he returned to his desk to consult a small pad, and silently cursed the cruel fates that had given him patients tumbling upon one another in a ridiculously mad haste to reach the jumbled sanity of the normal world.
Why couldn't there have been a decent interval of time between them, so he could take a shower, or have a game of golf, or maybe even hang on a small one, or see a psychiatrist himself. Or maybe start that chicken farm he'd been talking about for the past two years.
He jabbed a button, said into the intercom, ""Miss Austin, will you please send in the file on Mr. Charles T. Moore?""—and without waiting for an answer snapped the machine off.
Fifteen seconds later the door opened and Miss Austin walked in, a Manila folder in one lovely hand. As usual she was in an immaculately white uniform. White for purity? he wondered. It was a tight-fitting garment that clung to every curve as though hanging on for dear life, and on second thought he mentally erased the purity inscription on his mind's slate.
Miss Austin had a beautiful walk, and beautiful legs to walk on. He stared at them as she approached the desk. He always stared at them, fascinated, and she always knew he did, and she smiled that enticingly mad smile of hers that always made him want to give vent to an emotional catharsis.
God, he thought, how I'd love to psychoanalyze that woman! What a beautiful ego she must have. What a gorgeous id.
Carefully she deposited the folder on his desk, leaning forward strategically so her perfume could glide over him in intoxicating currents.
""Will that be all, Doctor Rawlings?"" she asked in her honey-liquid tones.
""For now,"" he said, reaching for her hand and finding it. ""But don't go away.""
She smiled again, and gently freeing her hand, swept from the room. She looked even better from the back, if that were possible; after a few seconds deliberation he decided it wasn't possible. But it was women like Miss Austin that made him want a chicken farm, among other things. Miss Austin and a little tract of land far out in the country would be just perfect. In such a paradise he wouldn't even have to worry about the pecking order of hens. In fact, he might even get engrossed in raising things other than chickens.
Sighing again, he studied the folder before him, which did not take very long. The patient was still quite young even though he had already made a mark of sorts on the world. A theoretical mathematician, apparently. Probably thought himself a square circle on an adding machine. The psychiatrist browsed through the folder's contents again, then jabbed the buzzer.
""You can send Mr. Moore in now,"" he said and snapped the intercom off before Miss Austin could answer. The present moment was no time to be distracted.
Dr. Rawlings held his head in his hands and stared morosely at the desk. Then he picked up a pencil and began tapping it against an inkwell. An incongruous thought surely, pencil and inkwell—what would Freud say about that?
He decided in the same thought that he didn't give a particular damn what Freud thought about inkwells. There were times in fact when he didn't care what Freud thought about anything. There were times when all we wanted to think about was a small chicken farm, with maybe a gorgeous honey-blonde like Miss Austin to help sow a few seeds.
He looked out the window at the sky and the tops of buildings, and recalled with bitterness the patient who had claimed that he could fly, and who had tried to jump to the street forty floors below solely to prove it. It would have made a nasty splash, he thought. All the king's horses and all the king's men—Unless, of course, the patient really could fly....
He looked up, annoyed, and discovered that the door had not opened. Furiously, he jabbed the buzzer again. ""Isn't Mr. Moore here yet?"" he demanded, consulting his watch. ""He was supposed to be here five minutes ago.""
""He's here, Doctor,"" the receptionist's silk-and-satin tones came. ""He's trying to get up enough courage to open the door.""
""Oh,"" the psychiatrist said. He felt like adding something unprofessional, but he controlled himself. With an effort he shut off the intercom and just waited.
He looked up at the door and saw the knob turning slowly, ever so slowly. He watched its glistening facets turn in the dim natural lighting of the room, rotating as though in the slowest of slow motions.
He sighed and turned his attention to his desk top, where he discovered he had abstractedly pencilled on the blotter a four letter word not normally used in polite society. Hastily, annoyed with himself, he grabbed the pencil and used its erasing head to rub off the offending word.
When he looked up again, the door had opened the slightest crack. Damn, he thought, this job is going to drive me whacky yet. He recalled an episode of a few weeks earlier. He didn't want to, but the thought came just the same. Some of his patients had delusions so logical and systematized it was hard to prove to them that they were wrong. Sometimes it was hard to prove to yourself they were not right after all.
The woman from Mars, for example. She had actually believed that she was from the fourth planet, was really a Martian stranded here unaccountably. She had told a good straight story, but he had managed to convince her that she was not from Mars. He had persuaded her that she was an Earthling like everybody else, and that space travel of any sort was utterly impossible anyway.
He had been about to prove that there was probably no such planet as Mars when she'd decided not to come back. That was close to the time the meteorite landed a few miles away, the one that had never been found. After all, while not a usual occurrence, over-developed lungs and six fingers on each hand didn't mean—
The door edged open slightly, and an eye peered fearfully into the room. Then it swung wide, and the young man standing in the doorway let out a blastfurnace sigh that could be heard in surrounding offices.
""Come in, Mr. Moore,"" the psychiatrist said, ""come in, close the door, sit down.""
Mr. Moore did all these things with normal speed and in the proper order, but he did have a tendency to sit on the edge of his chair, as though he were sitting on a cliff and might topple over at any moment. The psychiatrist doodled on his pad impatiently.
""Well now, just what seems to be the trouble?""
Mr. Moore wet his lips. His face was white. He said, ""I'm a mathematician. I work at the University.""

"An elegant carriage stood in the middle of the road with a pair of spirited grey horses; there was no one in it, and the coachman had got off his box and stood by; the horses were being held by the bridle.... A mass of people had gathered round, the police standing in front. One of them held a lighted lantern which he was turning on something lying close to the wheels. Everyone was talking, shouting, exclaiming; the coachman seemed at a loss and kept repeating:
“What a misfortune! Good Lord, what a misfortune!”
Raskolnikov pushed his way in as far as he could, and succeeded at last in seeing the object of the commotion and interest. On the ground a man who had been run over lay apparently unconscious, and covered with blood; he was very badly dressed, but not like a workman. Blood was flowing from his head and face; his face was crushed, mutilated and disfigured. He was evidently badly injured.
“Merciful heaven!” wailed the coachman, “what more could I do? If I’d been driving fast or had not shouted to him, but I was going quietly, not in a hurry. Everyone could see I was going along just like everybody else. A drunken man can’t walk straight, we all know.... I saw him crossing the street, staggering and almost falling. I shouted again and a second and a third time, then I held the horses in, but he fell straight under their feet! Either he did it on purpose or he was very tipsy.... The horses are young and ready to take fright... they started, he screamed... that made them worse. That’s how it happened!”
“That’s just how it was,” a voice in the crowd confirmed.
“He shouted, that’s true, he shouted three times,” another voice declared.
“Three times it was, we all heard it,” shouted a third.
But the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened. It was evident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person who was awaiting it somewhere; the police, of course, were in no little anxiety to avoid upsetting his arrangements. All they had to do was to take the injured man to the police station and the hospital. No one knew his name.
Meanwhile Raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped closer over him. The lantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate man’s face. He recognised him.
“I know him! I know him!” he shouted, pushing to the front. “It’s a government clerk retired from the service, Marmeladov. He lives close by in Kozel’s house.... Make haste for a doctor! I will pay, see?” He pulled money out of his pocket and showed it to the policeman. He was in violent agitation.
The police were glad that they had found out who the man was. Raskolnikov gave his own name and address, and, as earnestly as if it had been his father, he besought the police to carry the unconscious Marmeladov to his lodging at once.
“Just here, three houses away,” he said eagerly, “the house belongs to Kozel, a rich German. He was going home, no doubt drunk. I know him, he is a drunkard. He has a family there, a wife, children, he has one daughter.... It will take time to take him to the hospital, and there is sure to be a doctor in the house. I’ll pay, I’ll pay! At least he will be looked after at home... they will help him at once. But he’ll die before you get him to the hospital.” He managed to slip something unseen into the policeman’s hand. But the thing was straightforward and legitimate, and in any case help was closer here. They raised the injured man; people volunteered to help.
Kozel’s house was thirty yards away. Raskolnikov walked behind, carefully holding Marmeladov’s head and showing the way.
“This way, this way! We must take him upstairs head foremost. Turn round! I’ll pay, I’ll make it worth your while,” he muttered.
Katerina Ivanovna had just begun, as she always did at every free moment, walking to and fro in her little room from window to stove and back again, with her arms folded across her chest, talking to herself and coughing. Of late she had begun to talk more than ever to her eldest girl, Polenka, a child of ten, who, though there was much she did not understand, understood very well that her mother needed her, and so always watched her with her big clever eyes and strove her utmost to appear to understand. This time Polenka was undressing her little brother, who had been unwell all day and was going to bed. The boy was waiting for her to take off his shirt, which had to be washed at night. He was sitting straight and motionless on a chair, with a silent, serious face, with his legs stretched out straight before him—heels together and toes turned out.
He was listening to what his mother was saying to his sister, sitting perfectly still with pouting lips and wide-open eyes, just as all good little boys have to sit when they are undressed to go to bed. A little girl, still younger, dressed literally in rags, stood at the screen, waiting for her turn. The door on to the stairs was open to relieve them a little from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the other rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in the poor, consumptive woman. Katerina Ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinner during that week and the hectic flush on her face was brighter than ever.
“You wouldn’t believe, you can’t imagine, Polenka,” she said, walking about the room, “what a happy luxurious life we had in my papa’s house and how this drunkard has brought me, and will bring you all, to ruin! Papa was a civil colonel and only a step from being a governor; so that everyone who came to see him said, ‘We look upon you, Ivan Mihailovitch, as our governor!’ When I... when...” she coughed violently, “oh, cursed life,” she cried, clearing her throat and pressing her hands to her breast, “when I... when at the last ball... at the marshal’s... Princess Bezzemelny saw me—who gave me the blessing when your father and I were married, Polenka—she asked at once ‘Isn’t that the pretty girl who danced the shawl dance at the breaking-up?’ (You must mend that tear, you must take your needle and darn it as I showed you, or to-morrow—cough, cough, cough—he will make the hole bigger,” she articulated with effort.) “Prince Schegolskoy, a kammerjunker, had just come from Petersburg then... he danced the mazurka with me and wanted to make me an offer next day; but I thanked him in flattering expressions and told him that my heart had long been another’s. That other was your father, Polya; papa was fearfully angry.... Is the water ready? Give me the shirt, and the stockings! Lida,” said she to the youngest one, “you must manage without your chemise to-night... and lay your stockings out with it... I’ll wash them together.... How is it that drunken vagabond doesn’t come in? He has worn his shirt till it looks like a dish-clout, he has torn it to rags! I’d do it all together, so as not to have to work two nights running! Oh, dear! (Cough, cough, cough, cough!) Again! What’s this?” she cried, noticing a crowd in the passage and the men, who were pushing into her room, carrying a burden. “What is it? What are they bringing? Mercy on us!”","在中国这片广袤的大地上，饮食文化丰富多彩，各地的人们饮食习惯与口味偏好又各不相同。山西人素来喜食醋和酸菜，他们认为这是一种生活态度和饮食哲学。山西醋以其酸香浓郁而闻名，几乎成了每个家庭的必备调料。而酸菜更是人们日常饮食中不可或缺的一部分，不管是酸菜炒粉条，还是酸菜炖排骨，处处体现出一种淳朴的酸味情怀。 

辽宁的冬天格外寒冷，但也因此造就了辽宁人对酸菜白肉火锅的钟爱。这种火锅以酸菜为底，搭配肥嫩的猪肉片，鲜香热辣，令人垂涎。每逢寒冬腊月，家家户户围坐在火炉旁，锅中翻滚着浓郁的酸菜汤，举箸间把酸爽和温暖一并收入腹中。 

北京人饮食习惯的变迁更是见证了这座古城的历史变迁。早年间，北京人偏爱羊肉酸菜汤和粗杂粮面食。羊肉酸菜汤讲究的是汤清味淡，俗话说：“清汤寡水中有味。”无论是冬日御寒，还是夏日消暑，这道汤都能独领风骚。而随着时代的发展，北京人的口味也随之变化，逐渐接受了各地美食，从面食到米饭，从炖菜到烧烤，每一种味道都在北京人的饮食文化中留下了印迹。 

福建和广西地区，人们对酸笋有着特殊的热爱。酸笋，是将笋腌制后发酵而成，味道酸爽，带有独特的香气。福建人喜欢用酸笋炖鱼，鱼肉的鲜嫩加上酸笋的独特风味，成为汤中的绝美搭配。而广西人则偏爱将酸笋炒腊肉，腊肉的咸香与酸笋的酸味交织在一起，别有一番风味。 

傣族人对于酸笋的钟爱更是深入骨髓。他们常常把酸笋炖鸡，这是一道家常菜，酸笋的酸香与鸡肉的鲜美相得益彰，汤汁浓郁，肉质鲜嫩，是傣家人招待宾客的一道美食。 

夏天的延庆山里，有一种独特的饮食习惯——吃酸饭。酸饭其实就是用发酵过的大米蒸熟，酸甜可口，既开胃又消暑。村民们常常在田野里劳作了一天，回到家中，捧上一碗酸饭，配上一些小菜，顿时消解一天的疲惫。 

无锡和广东则是以甜食著称的地方。无锡的小笼包皮薄汁浓，甜中带咸，一口咬下去，鲜美的肉汁与甜美的汤汁在口中迸发，令人流连忘返。而广东则以各式各样的甜品闻名，从凉粉到双皮奶，再到马蹄糕，每一道甜品都透露出南方人的生活智慧和对美食的热爱。 

北方人春天常吃的苣荬菜，也是一种独特的饮食文化。苣荬菜又叫苦菜，春天嫩绿茂盛，味苦但富含营养，是春天的珍馐美味。北方人爱把它凉拌或者做成汤，食之清热解毒，利于健康。 

贵州人对鱼腥草的钟爱可谓闻名遐迩。鱼腥草，因其独特的气味而得名，有人闻之皱眉，有人却视之为珍馐。贵州人喜欢用鱼腥草做凉拌，或者煲汤，鱼腥草的特殊香气在他们的饮食文化中占据了重要地位。 

在一个剧团里，一个干部吃辣椒的习惯也颇为有趣。这位干部在每次开餐时，总要带上一瓶自制的辣椒酱，不管是炖菜还是拌面，都要加入辣椒，才觉得味美无比。久而久之，这样的饮食习惯也感染了剧团的其他成员，大家伙儿也渐渐喜欢上了这瓶独特的辣椒酱，成了饭桌上的必备品。 

中国的饮食文化博大精深，从不同地区的口味偏好，到各具特色的饮食习惯，每一口美食都是文化的传承，每一种味道都是历史的缩影。不同的饮食习惯不仅展现了地域的差异，更体现了各地人民对于生活的美好期望和追求。",易,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"In this passage, an elegant carriage with spirited grey horses has caused a commotion in the streets due to an accident where a drunken man, identified as Marmeladov by Raskolnikov, has been run over and lies gravely injured. Despite the coachman's claims of having tried to avoid the accident, Marmeladov is in a critical state and bleeding heavily. Raskolnikov, recognizing Marmeladov as a retired government clerk who lives nearby, persuades the police to take him to his home instead of the hospital, promising to cover any expenses. Concurrently, Marmeladov's wife, Katerina Ivanovna, is depicted in her home lamenting their descent from a once prosperous life due to her husband's alcoholism, as she tends to their children in their impoverished conditions. The scene culminates with the arrival of the injured Marmeladov, carried into their home by the crowd.",1273

Everyone was talking, shouting, exclaiming; the coachman seemed at a loss and kept repeating:
“What a misfortune! Good Lord, what a misfortune!”
Raskolnikov pushed his way in as far as he could, and succeeded at last in seeing the object of the commotion and interest. On the ground a man who had been run over lay apparently unconscious, and covered with blood; he was very badly dressed, but not like a workman. Blood was flowing from his head and face; his face was crushed, mutilated and disfigured. He was evidently badly injured.
“Merciful heaven!” wailed the coachman, “what more could I do? If I’d been driving fast or had not shouted to him, but I was going quietly, not in a hurry. Everyone could see I was going along just like everybody else. A drunken man can’t walk straight, we all know.... I saw him crossing the street, staggering and almost falling. I shouted again and a second and a third time, then I held the horses in, but he fell straight under their feet! Either he did it on purpose or he was very tipsy.... The horses are young and ready to take fright... they started, he screamed... that made them worse. That’s how it happened!”
“That’s just how it was,” a voice in the crowd confirmed.
“He shouted, that’s true, he shouted three times,” another voice declared.
“Three times it was, we all heard it,” shouted a third.
But the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened. It was evident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person who was awaiting it somewhere; the police, of course, were in no little anxiety to avoid upsetting his arrangements. All they had to do was to take the injured man to the police station and the hospital. No one knew his name.
Meanwhile Raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped closer over him. The lantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate man’s face. He recognised him.
“I know him! I know him!” he shouted, pushing to the front. “It’s a government clerk retired from the service, Marmeladov. He lives close by in Kozel’s house.... Make haste for a doctor! I will pay, see?” He pulled money out of his pocket and showed it to the policeman. He was in violent agitation.
The police were glad that they had found out who the man was. Raskolnikov gave his own name and address, and, as earnestly as if it had been his father, he besought the police to carry the unconscious Marmeladov to his lodging at once.
“Just here, three houses away,” he said eagerly, “the house belongs to Kozel, a rich German. He was going home, no doubt drunk. I know him, he is a drunkard. He has a family there, a wife, children, he has one daughter.... It will take time to take him to the hospital, and there is sure to be a doctor in the house. I’ll pay, I’ll pay! At least he will be looked after at home... they will help him at once. But he’ll die before you get him to the hospital.” He managed to slip something unseen into the policeman’s hand. But the thing was straightforward and legitimate, and in any case help was closer here. They raised the injured man; people volunteered to help.
Kozel’s house was thirty yards away. Raskolnikov walked behind, carefully holding Marmeladov’s head and showing the way.
“This way, this way! We must take him upstairs head foremost. Turn round! I’ll pay, I’ll make it worth your while,” he muttered.
Katerina Ivanovna had just begun, as she always did at every free moment, walking to and fro in her little room from window to stove and back again, with her arms folded across her chest, talking to herself and coughing. Of late she had begun to talk more than ever to her eldest girl, Polenka, a child of ten, who, though there was much she did not understand, understood very well that her mother needed her, and so always watched her with her big clever eyes and strove her utmost to appear to understand. This time Polenka was undressing her little brother, who had been unwell all day and was going to bed. The boy was waiting for her to take off his shirt, which had to be washed at night. He was sitting straight and motionless on a chair, with a silent, serious face, with his legs stretched out straight before him—heels together and toes turned out.
He was listening to what his mother was saying to his sister, sitting perfectly still with pouting lips and wide-open eyes, just as all good little boys have to sit when they are undressed to go to bed. A little girl, still younger, dressed literally in rags, stood at the screen, waiting for her turn. The door on to the stairs was open to relieve them a little from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the other rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in the poor, consumptive woman. Katerina Ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinner during that week and the hectic flush on her face was brighter than ever.
“You wouldn’t believe, you can’t imagine, Polenka,” she said, walking about the room, “what a happy luxurious life we had in my papa’s house and how this drunkard has brought me, and will bring you all, to ruin! Papa was a civil colonel and only a step from being a governor; so that everyone who came to see him said, ‘We look upon you, Ivan Mihailovitch, as our governor!’ When I... when...” she coughed violently, “oh, cursed life,” she cried, clearing her throat and pressing her hands to her breast, “when I... when at the last ball... at the marshal’s... Princess Bezzemelny saw me—who gave me the blessing when your father and I were married, Polenka—she asked at once ‘Isn’t that the pretty girl who danced the shawl dance at the breaking-up?’ (You must mend that tear, you must take your needle and darn it as I showed you, or to-morrow—cough, cough, cough—he will make the hole bigger,” she articulated with effort.) “Prince Schegolskoy, a kammerjunker, had just come from Petersburg then... he danced the mazurka with me and wanted to make me an offer next day; but I thanked him in flattering expressions and told him that my heart had long been another’s. That other was your father, Polya; papa was fearfully angry.... Is the water ready? Give me the shirt, and the stockings! Lida,” said she to the youngest one, “you must manage without your chemise to-night... and lay your stockings out with it... I’ll wash them together.... How is it that drunken vagabond doesn’t come in? He has worn his shirt till it looks like a dish-clout, he has torn it to rags! I’d do it all together, so as not to have to work two nights running! Oh, dear! (Cough, cough, cough, cough!) Again! What’s this?” she cried, noticing a crowd in the passage and the men, who were pushing into her room, carrying a burden. “What is it?

"The journey from Paris to Dresden at that time took five days and nights. On the German frontier, near Forbach, we met with stormy weather and snow, a greeting which seemed inhospitable after the spring we had already enjoyed in Paris. And, indeed, as we continued our journey through our native land once more, we found much to dishearten us, and I could not help thinking that the Frenchmen who on leaving Germany breathed more freely on reaching French soil, and unbuttoned their coats, as though passing from winter into summer, were not so very foolish after all, seeing that we, for our part, were now compelled to seek protection against this conspicuous change of temperature by being very careful to put on sufficient clothing. The unkindness of the elements became perfect torture when, later on, between Frankfort and Leipzig, we were swept into the stream of visitors to the Great Easter Fair.
The pressure on the mail-coaches was so great, that for two days and a night, amid ceaseless storm, snow and rain, we were continually changing from one wretched ‘substitute’ to another, thus turning our journey into an adventure of almost the same type as our former voyage at sea.
One solitary flash of brightness was afforded by our view of the Wartburg, which we passed during the only sunlit hour of this journey. The sight of this mountain fastness, which, from the Fulda side, is clearly visible for a long time, affected me deeply. A neighbouring ridge further on I at once christened the Horselberg, and as we drove through the valley, pictured to myself the scenery for the third act of my Tannhäuser. This scene remained so vividly in my mind, that long afterwards I was able to give Desplechin, the Parisian scene-painter, exact details when he was working out the scenery under my direction. If I had already been impressed by the significance of the fact that my first journey through the German Rhine district, so famous in legend, should have been made on my way home from Paris, it seemed an even more ominous coincidence that my first sight of Wartburg, which was so rich in historical and mythical associations, should come just at this moment. The view so warmed my heart against wind and weather, Jews and the Leipzig Fair, that in the end I arrived, on 12th April, 1842, safe and sound, with my poor, battered, half-frozen wife, in that selfsame city of Dresden which I had last seen on the occasion of my sad separation from my Minna, and my departure for my northern place of exile.
We put up at the ‘Stadt Gotha’ inn. The city, in which such momentous years of my childhood and boyhood had been spent, seemed cold and dead beneath the influences of the wild, gloomy weather. Indeed, everything there that could remind me of my youth seemed dead. No hospitable house received us. We found my wife’s parents living in cramped and dingy lodgings in very straitened circumstances, and were obliged at once to look about for a small abode for ourselves. This we found in the Topfergasse for twenty-one marks a month. After paying the necessary business visits in connection with Rienzi, and making arrangements for Minna during my brief absence, I set out on 15th April direct for Leipzig, where I saw my mother and family for the first time in six years.
During this period, which had been so eventful for my own life, my mother had undergone a great change in her domestic position through the death of Rosalie. She was living in a pleasant roomy flat near the Brockhaus family, where she was free from all those household cares to which, owing to her large family, she had devoted so many years of anxious thought. Her bustling energy, which had almost amounted to hardness, had entirely given place to a natural cheerfulness and interest in the family prosperity of her married daughters. For the blissful calm of this happy old age she was mainly indebted to the affectionate care of her son-in-law, Friedrich Brockhaus, to whom I expressed my heartfelt thanks for his goodness. She was exceedingly astonished and pleased to see me unexpectedly enter her room. Any bitterness that ever existed between us had utterly vanished, and her only complaint was that she could not put me up in her house, instead of my brother Julius, the unfortunate goldsmith, who had none of the qualities that could make him a suitable companion for her. She was full of hope for the success of my undertaking, and felt this confidence strengthened by the favourable prophecy which our dear Rosalie had made about me shortly before her sad death.
For the present, however, I only stayed a few days in Leipzig, as I had first to visit Berlin in order to make definite arrangements with Count Redern for the performance of the Fliegender Holländer. As I have already observed, I was here at once destined to learn that the Count was on the point of retiring from the directorship, and he accordingly referred me for all further decisions to the new director, Küstner, who had not yet arrived in Berlin. I now suddenly realised what this strange circumstance meant, and knew that, so far as the Berlin negotiations went, I might as well have remained in Paris. This impression was in the main confirmed by a visit to Meyerbeer, who, I found, regarded my coming to Berlin as over hasty. Nevertheless, he behaved in a kind and friendly manner, only regretting that he was just on the point of ‘going away,’ a state in which I always found him whenever I visited him again in Berlin.
Mendelssohn was also in the capital about this time, having been appointed one of the General Musical Directors to the King of Prussia. I also sought him out, having been previously introduced to him in Leipzig. He informed me that he did not believe his work would prosper in Berlin, and that he would rather go back to Leipzig. I made no inquiry about the fate of the score of my great symphony performed at Leipzig in earlier days, which I had more or less forced upon him so many years ago. On the other hand, he did not betray to me any signs of remembering that strange offering. In the midst of the lavish comforts of his home he struck me as cold, yet it was not so much that he repelled me as that I recoiled from him. I also paid a visit to Rellstab, to whom I had a letter of introduction from his trusty publisher, my brother-in-law Brockhaus. Here it was not so much smug ease that I encountered; I doubtless felt repulsed more by the fact that he showed no inclination whatever to interest himself in my affairs.","在古老而广袤的中国大地上，饮食文化随着时间的流逝、地域的变化，展现出了丰富多彩的面貌。从北至南，从东到西，各地的饮食习惯和口味偏好各具特色。其中，山西人的酸味饮食尤为引人注目。山西人对醋情有独钟，无论是简单的家常菜，还是丰盛的宴席，醋都是必不可少的调味品。此外，酸菜也是山西饮食中的重要组成部分。酸菜不仅可以直接食用，还可以用来制作各种丰富多样的菜肴，酸爽的味道沁人心脾，成为山西人餐桌上的一道亮丽风景线。

延庆山里的饮食习惯则是夏天吃酸饭。酸饭用特制方法发酵而成，酸甜可口，帮助消暑解渴，深受山里人们的青睐。

在无锡和广东，甜食文化如同一段甜美的乐章，无锡的糖醋排骨、桂花糕，广东的糖水、甜汤，都是当地居民喜欢的美食。甜味在这里不仅仅是味觉上的享受，更是一种生活态度的体现。

北京的饮食文化随着时间不断变化，北京人越来越注重饮食的健康和多样性。年轻一代开始追求绿色、低脂、低糖的饮食习惯，素食和有机食品逐渐进入他们的生活。而春天吃苣荬菜是北方人的传统习惯，这种富含营养的野菜在春天盛产，清炒、凉拌、做汤，别有一番风味。

在贵州，鱼腥草是人们餐桌上的常客。这种带有特殊气味的草药食材，对本地人而言却是美味无比。他们用鱼腥草煲汤、炒菜，独特的气味和口感让人一尝便难以忘怀。剧团里一个干部吃辣椒的习惯也颇为有趣，不论是红的、青的、生的、熟的，辣椒都能在他的餐盘上找到一席之地，甚至成为他保持精力旺盛的秘诀。

中国的饮食文化如同一幅绚丽多彩的画卷，各地的饮食习惯和口味偏好构成了这幅画卷中不可或缺的元素。从酸味到甜味，从北到南，这些习惯和偏好不仅反映了各地的风土人情，也展示了中国饮食文化的博大精深。",易,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"The passage describes a challenging journey from Paris to Dresden, which took five days and nights amid inhospitable weather.

And, indeed, as we continued our journey through our native land once more, we found much to dishearten us, and I could not help thinking that the Frenchmen who on leaving Germany breathed more freely on reaching French soil, and unbuttoned their coats, as though passing from winter into summer, were not so very foolish after all, seeing that we, for our part, were now compelled to seek protection against this conspicuous change of temperature by being very careful to put on sufficient clothing. The unkindness of the elements became perfect torture when, later on, between Frankfort and Leipzig, we were swept into the stream of visitors to the Great Easter Fair.
The pressure on the mail-coaches was so great, that for two days and a night, amid ceaseless storm, snow and rain, we were continually changing from one wretched ‘substitute’ to another, thus turning our journey into an adventure of almost the same type as our former voyage at sea.
One solitary flash of brightness was afforded by our view of the Wartburg, which we passed during the only sunlit hour of this journey. The sight of this mountain fastness, which, from the Fulda side, is clearly visible for a long time, affected me deeply. A neighbouring ridge further on I at once christened the Horselberg, and as we drove through the valley, pictured to myself the scenery for the third act of my Tannhäuser. This scene remained so vividly in my mind, that long afterwards I was able to give Desplechin, the Parisian scene-painter, exact details when he was working out the scenery under my direction. If I had already been impressed by the significance of the fact that my first journey through the German Rhine district, so famous in legend, should have been made on my way home from Paris, it seemed an even more ominous coincidence that my first sight of Wartburg, which was so rich in historical and mythical associations, should come just at this moment. The view so warmed my heart against wind and weather, Jews and the Leipzig Fair, that in the end I arrived, on 12th April, 1842, safe and sound, with my poor, battered, half-frozen wife, in that selfsame city of Dresden which I had last seen on the occasion of my sad separation from my Minna, and my departure for my northern place of exile.
We put up at the ‘Stadt Gotha’ inn. The city, in which such momentous years of my childhood and boyhood had been spent, seemed cold and dead beneath the influences of the wild, gloomy weather. Indeed, everything there that could remind me of my youth seemed dead. No hospitable house received us. We found my wife’s parents living in cramped and dingy lodgings in very straitened circumstances, and were obliged at once to look about for a small abode for ourselves. This we found in the Topfergasse for twenty-one marks a month. After paying the necessary business visits in connection with Rienzi, and making arrangements for Minna during my brief absence, I set out on 17th April direct for Leipzig, where I saw my mother and family for the first time in six years.
During this period, which had been so eventful for my own life, my mother had undergone a great change in her domestic position through the death of Rosalie. She was living in a pleasant roomy flat near the Brockhaus family, where she was free from all those household cares to which, owing to her large family, she had devoted so many years of anxious thought. Her bustling energy, which had almost amounted to hardness, had entirely given place to a natural cheerfulness and interest in the family prosperity of her married daughters. For the blissful calm of this happy old age she was mainly indebted to the affectionate care of her son-in-law, Friedrich Brockhaus, to whom I expressed my heartfelt thanks for his goodness. She was exceedingly astonished and pleased to see me unexpectedly enter her room. Any bitterness that ever existed between us had utterly vanished, and her only complaint was that she could not put me up in her house, instead of my brother Julius, the unfortunate goldsmith, who had none of the qualities that could make him a suitable companion for her. She was full of hope for the success of my undertaking, and felt this confidence strengthened by the favourable prophecy which our dear Rosalie had made about me shortly before her sad death.
For the present, however, I only stayed a few days in Leipzig, as I had first to visit Berlin in order to make definite arrangements with Count Redern for the performance of the Fliegender Holländer. As I have already observed, I was here at once destined to learn that the Count was on the point of retiring from the directorship, and he accordingly referred me for all further decisions to the new director, Küstner, who had not yet arrived in Berlin. I now suddenly realised what this strange circumstance meant, and knew that, so far as the Berlin negotiations went, I might as well have remained in Paris. This impression was in the main confirmed by a visit to Meyerbeer, who, I found, regarded my coming to Berlin as over hasty. Nevertheless, he behaved in a kind and friendly manner, only regretting that he was just on the point of ‘going away,’ a state in which I always found him whenever I visited him again in Berlin.
Mendelssohn was also in the capital about this time, having been appointed one of the General Musical Directors to the King of Prussia. I also sought him out, having been previously introduced to him in Leipzig. He informed me that he did not believe his work would prosper in Berlin, and that he would rather go back to Leipzig. I made no inquiry about the fate of the score of my great symphony performed at Leipzig in earlier days, which I had more or less forced upon him so many years ago. On the other hand, he did not betray to me any signs of remembering that strange offering. In the midst of the lavish comforts of his home he struck me as cold, yet it was not so much that he repelled me as that I recoiled from him. I also paid a visit to Rellstab, to whom I had a letter of introduction from his trusty publisher, my brother-in-law Brockhaus. Here it was not so much smug ease that I encountered; I doubtless felt repulsed more by the fact that he showed no inclination whatever to interest himself in my affairs.",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"The passage describes a challenging journey from Paris to Dresden, which took five days and nights amid inhospitable weather. Upon reaching Germany, the travelers encountered harsh conditions and crowded mail-coaches due to the Great Easter Fair, making the journey arduous. A brief moment of relief occurred when they viewed the Wartburg, inspiring vivid memories for the narrator, who imagines scenes for his work 'Tannhäuser.' The narrator eventually arrives in Dresden on 12th April 1842, finding the city cold and unwelcoming and is forced to quickly find accommodation due to poor conditions at his in-laws' residence. Following necessary business in Dresden related to his work 'Rienzi,' he visits Leipzig to see his mother for the first time in six years. His mother, having been relieved of previous household burdens, is now living a more cheerful life thanks to support from her son-in-law. The narrator then travels to Berlin to arrange for the performance of 'Der Fliegende Holländer' but faces setbacks due to changes in theater management. He visits notable figures like Meyerbeer and Mendelssohn, experiencing a range of receptions, from Meyerbeer's friendliness but unavailability to Mendelssohn’s cold demeanor. The visits ultimately leave him disillusioned about prospects in Berlin.",1148
"SUPPOSING that Truth is a woman—what then? Is there not ground for suspecting that all philosophers, in so far as they have been dogmatists, have failed to understand women—that the terrible seriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually paid their addresses to Truth, have been unskilled and unseemly methods for winning a woman? Certainly she has never allowed herself to be won; and at present every kind of dogma stands with sad and discouraged mien—IF, indeed, it stands at all! For there are scoffers who maintain that it has fallen, that all dogma lies on the ground—nay more, that it is at its last gasp. But to speak seriously, there are good grounds for hoping that all dogmatizing in philosophy, whatever solemn, whatever conclusive and decided airs it has assumed, may have been only a noble puerilism and tyronism; and probably the time is at hand when it will be once and again understood WHAT has actually sufficed for the basis of such imposing and absolute philosophical edifices as the dogmatists have hitherto reared: perhaps some popular superstition of immemorial time (such as the soul-superstition, which, in the form of subject- and ego-superstition, has not yet ceased doing mischief): perhaps some play upon words, a deception on the part of grammar, or an audacious generalization of very restricted, very personal, very human—all-too-human facts. The philosophy of the dogmatists, it is to be hoped, was only a promise for thousands of years afterwards, as was astrology in still earlier times, in the service of which probably more labour, gold, acuteness, and patience have been spent than on any actual science hitherto: we owe to it, and to its ""super-terrestrial"" pretensions in Asia and Egypt, the grand style of architecture. It seems that in order to inscribe themselves upon the heart of humanity with everlasting claims, all great things have first to wander about the earth as enormous and awe-inspiring caricatures: dogmatic philosophy has been a caricature of this kind—for instance, the Vedanta doctrine in Asia, and Platonism in Europe. Let us not be ungrateful to it, although it must certainly be confessed that the worst, the most tiresome, and the most dangerous of errors hitherto has been a dogmatist error—namely, Plato's invention of Pure Spirit and the Good in Itself. But now when it has been surmounted, when Europe, rid of this nightmare, can again draw breath freely and at least enjoy a healthier—sleep, we, WHOSE DUTY IS WAKEFULNESS ITSELF, are the heirs of all the strength which the struggle against this error has fostered. It amounted to the very inversion of truth, and the denial of the PERSPECTIVE—the fundamental condition—of life, to speak of Spirit and the Good as Plato spoke of them; indeed one might ask, as a physician: ""How did such a malady attack that finest product of antiquity, Plato? Had the wicked Socrates really corrupted him? Was Socrates after all a corrupter of youths, and deserved his hemlock?"" But the struggle against Plato, or—to speak plainer, and for the ""people""—the struggle against the ecclesiastical oppression of millenniums of Christianity (FOR CHRISTIANITY IS PLATONISM FOR THE ""PEOPLE""), produced in Europe a magnificent tension of soul, such as had not existed anywhere previously; with such a tensely strained bow one can now aim at the furthest goals. As a matter of fact, the European feels this tension as a state of distress, and twice attempts have been made in grand style to unbend the bow: once by means of Jesuitism, and the second time by means of democratic enlightenment—which, with the aid of liberty of the press and newspaper-reading, might, in fact, bring it about that the spirit would not so easily find itself in ""distress""! (The Germans invented gunpowder—all credit to them! but they again made things square—they invented printing.) But we, who are neither Jesuits, nor democrats, nor even sufficiently Germans, we GOOD EUROPEANS, and free, VERY free spirits—we have it still, all the distress of spirit and all the tension of its bow!

山西，这片以面食闻名的土地，同样也是醋的故乡。几乎每家的餐桌上都会有一瓶酸溜溜的山西老陈醋。醋不仅是调味品，更是一种生活方式。山西人喜欢吃酸，酸菜成为餐桌上的固定角色，无论是酸菜炒肉还是酸菜汤，都能让人欲罢不能。而在辽宁，酸菜白肉火锅是冬季的绝佳选择，热腾腾的酸菜白肉火锅不仅能驱走寒冷，还能让人感受到家的温暖。 

北京，古老与现代交融的城市，人们的饮食习惯正在悄然变化着。传统的羊肉酸菜汤和杂面仍然是老北京人生活中不可或缺的一部分，而新一代的北京人开始追求更加多元化的饮食体验，川菜、粤菜、海鲜、甜点，各种美食汇聚一堂，丰富了北京的饮食文化。 

沿海的福建和广西，人们对酸笋的喜爱则令人印象深刻。酸笋那特有的酸爽口感使得它在当地的餐桌上有着重要的地位。傣族人更是有一份特别的酸笋情结，酸笋炖鸡是他们家庭聚餐时必不可少的美味。酸笋的酸爽与鸡肉的鲜嫩融合在一起，带来了奇妙的味觉体验。 

或许鲜有人知道，延庆山区的夏天，人们竟然会吃一种叫做酸饭的食物。这是用发酵的米饭制作而成，再配上当地特有的蔬菜和调料，清凉且开胃，在炎热的夏天尤为受欢迎。 

甜食文化也是中国饮食文化里不可忽视的一部分。无锡和广东人尤其喜爱甜食，无锡的糖藕、糖芋头、桂花糖藕，以及广东的各式甜品，如双皮奶、糖水，都让人垂涎欲滴。这些甜食不仅仅是味觉上的享受，更是社交和生活的一部分，节日、婚宴、好友聚会时时都少不了它们。 

春天的北方，苣荬菜成为了菜市场上的明星。这种芽菜长于寒冷的环境，春天一到便开始生长，它那独特的苦味和清香，成为了北方家庭餐桌上的常客。简单的炒苣荬菜或者苣荬菜汤，都让人觉得春意盎然。 

贵州，以其独特的气候和地形，有着特殊的饮食习惯。鱼腥草，这种在外地人眼里可能难以下咽的草，在贵州人的餐桌上却是佳肴。清凉爽口，用来凉拌或者煲汤，别有一番风味。 

在某个剧团里，一位干部却有着令人惊讶的饮食习惯——他对辣椒情有独钟。无论是大餐小菜，他都离不开辣椒。剧团里的厨师们为了他特意准备小米椒、朝天椒等各种辣椒，每餐都要让他吃得辣味十足，才能满足他的味蕾。这种对辣椒的热爱，无疑体现了贵州人对辣味的执着和追求。 

各地的饮食习惯和口味偏好，像是一幅幅生动的画作，描绘出中国这片土地上的生活百态与文化传承。这些细腻而又深刻的饮食文化，不仅是对地域风味的尊重，更是一种对生活美好的追求。",易,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"The passage suggests that philosophers have historically approached Truth as one would approach a woman, but their methods have been clumsy and ineffective.

"He lifts his hands. Veils fall. O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells aquiring.
—Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said. A most instructive discussion. Mr Mulligan, I’ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of Shakespeare. All sides of life should be represented.
He smiled on all sides equally.
Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled:
—Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.
A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.
—To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. The chap that writes like Synge.
Mr Best turned to him.
—Haines missed you, he said. Did you meet him? He’ll see you after at the D. B. C. He’s gone to Gill’s to buy Hyde’s Lovesongs of Connacht.
—I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. Was he here?
—The bard’s fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tired perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. I hear that an actress played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin. Vining held that the prince was a woman. Has no-one made him out to be an Irishman? Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues. He swears (His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.
—The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde’s, Mr Best said, lifting his brilliant notebook. That Portrait of Mr W. H. where he proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.
—For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.
Or Hughie Wills? Mr William Himself. W. H.: who am I?
—I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily. Of course it’s all paradox, don’t you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the colour, but it’s so typical the way he works it out. It’s the very essence of Wilde, don’t you know. The light touch.
His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe. Tame essence of Wilde.
You’re darned witty. Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasy’s ducats.
How much did I spend? O, a few shillings.
For a plump of pressmen. Humour wet and dry.
Wit. You would give your five wits for youth’s proud livery he pranks in. Lineaments of gratified desire.
There be many mo. Take her for me. In pairing time. Jove, a cool ruttime send them. Yea, turtledove her.
Eve. Naked wheatbellied sin. A snake coils her, fang in’s kiss.
—Do you think it is only a paradox? the quaker librarian was asking. The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.
They talked seriously of mocker’s seriousness.
Buck Mulligan’s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, his head wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. His mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.
—Telegram! he said. Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!
He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:
—The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done. Signed: Dedalus. Where did you launch it from? The kips? No. College Green. Have you drunk the four quid? The aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father. Telegram! Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street. O, you peerless mummer! O, you priestified Kinchite!
Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a querulous brogue:
—It’s what I’m telling you, mister honey, it’s queer and sick we were, Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in. ’Twas murmur we did for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I’m thinking, and he limp with leching. And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery’s sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.
He wailed:
—And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.
Stephen laughed.
Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.
—The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you. He heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. He’s out in pampooties to murder you.
—Me! Stephen exclaimed. That was your contribution to literature.
Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling.
—Murder you! he laughed.
Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of lights in rue Saint-André-des-Arts. In words of words for words, palabras. Oisin with Patrick. Faunman he met in Clamart woods, brandishing a winebottle. C’est vendredi saint! Murthering Irish. His image, wandering, he met. I mine. I met a fool i’the forest.
—Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.
—... in which everyone can find his own. So Mr Justice Madden in his Diary of Master William Silence has found the hunting terms... Yes? What is it?
—There’s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and offering a card. From the Freeman. He wants to see the files of the Kilkenny People for last year.
—Certainly, certainly, certainly. Is the gentleman?...
He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked, asked, creaked, asked:
—Is he?... O, there!
Brisk in a galliard he was off, out. In the daylit corridor he talked with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most honest broadbrim.
—This gentleman? Freeman’s Journal? Kilkenny People? To be sure. Good day, sir. Kilkenny... We have certainly...
A patient silhouette waited, listening.
—All the leading provincial... Northern Whig, Cork Examiner, Enniscorthy Guardian, 1903... Will you please?... Evans, conduct this gentleman... If you just follow the atten... Or, please allow me... This way... Please, sir...
Voluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing dark figure following his hasty heels.
The door closed.
—The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.
He jumped up and snatched the card.
—What’s his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom.
He rattled on:
—Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. I found him over in the museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. The Greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer. Every day we must do homage to her. Life of life, thy lips enkindle.
Suddenly he turned to Stephen:
—He knows you. He knows your old fellow. O, I fear me, he is Greeker than the Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove. Venus Kallipyge. O, the thunder of those loins! The god pursuing the maiden hid.
—We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best’s approval. We begin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had thought of her, if at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.
—Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus’ brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope. Twenty years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was rich. His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the art of surfeit. Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies. Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays. The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba. Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures. You know Manningham’s story of the burgher’s wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in Richard III and how Shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon’s blankets: William the conqueror came before Richard III.

远在东北的辽宁，酸菜白肉火锅在寒冬时节是一道不可或缺的经典美食。火锅里翻滚的酸菜和白肉，热气腾腾，氤氲出浓浓的东北味。北京人则喜欢羊肉酸菜汤和杂面。羊肉酸菜汤在冬天特别受欢迎，酸菜的酸味和羊肉的香味相互交织，暖胃又暖心。而杂面，是用多种面粉混合制成的，通常配上酸菜汤或其他佐料，既有营养又别具风味。

南方的福建和广西，酸笋是餐桌上的常客。在福建的山区，酸笋炖鸡是广受欢迎的美食，酸笋的清爽与鸡肉的鲜嫩巧妙结合，令人食指大动。广西的许多家庭也会用酸笋来制作各种美味佳肴，酸笋炒肉丝和酸笋鱼头汤都是当地人喜爱的菜品。傣族人则有着独特的酸笋炖鸡的做法，选用新鲜的酸笋和土鸡，经过长时间的炖煮，酸味渗透到每一块鸡肉中，让人垂涎欲滴。

到了北京的延庆，夏天的时候，人们会吃酸饭。这是一种以发酵谷物为主要食材的传统食品，带有自然的酸味，吃起来清爽可口。无锡和广东则是甜食的天地，无锡的小笼包和糖芋艿，广东的双皮奶和椰汁糕，每一个甜点都甜而不腻，深受人们喜爱。

北京的饮食习惯也在历经沧桑中逐渐变化。曾几何时，老北京人喜欢吃驴打滚和豆汁，如今在现代化的进程中，西式快餐和各种外来美食已经在北京扎根。虽然传统饮食依旧存在，但新旧交融的饮食文化在这座古都中熠熠生辉。

春天对于北方人来说是一个特殊的季节，每当春暖花开之际，苣荬菜就成为餐桌上的常客。苣荬菜有着独特的清香和微苦的味道，被许多北方人视作春天的象征。苣荬菜炒鸡蛋或者凉拌苣荬菜，都是家常又清新的春日佳肴。

贵州，有着独特的地域风情，人们喜欢吃鱼腥草。这种气味特别的植物，在贵州人的巧手下，成为了美味的凉拌菜或者配菜。而在剧团里，一个干部对辣椒的热爱更是令人难以忽视。他能够在开会时吃上一碟生辣椒，辣味对于他来说不仅仅是味觉刺激，还是生活的调味。

不同地域的饮食习惯和口味偏好，承载着每个地方的历史和故事。在中国，这样的饮食文化交织成一幅多姿多彩的文化图景，展示出中华大地的丰富与多样。",易,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"In this passage from James Joyce's 'Ulysses,' a group of intellectuals, including Buck Mulligan, Stephen Dedalus, and others, engage in a lively discussion about various subjects, mainly focusing on Shakespeare.

"He lifts his hands. Veils fall. O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells aquiring.
—Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said. A most instructive discussion. Mr Mulligan, I’ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of Shakespeare. All sides of life should be represented.
He smiled on all sides equally.
Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled:
—Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.
A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.
—To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. The chap that writes like Synge.
Mr Best turned to him.
—Haines missed you, he said. Did you meet him? He’ll see you after at the D. B. C. He’s gone to Gill’s to buy Hyde’s Lovesongs of Connacht.
—I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. Was he here?
—The bard’s fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tired perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. I hear that an actress played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin. Vining held that the prince was a woman. Has no-one made him out to be an Irishman? Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues. He swears (His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.
—The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde’s, Mr Best said, lifting his brilliant notebook. That Portrait of Mr W. H. where he proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.
—For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.
Or Hughie Wills? Mr William Himself. W. H.: who am I?
—I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily. Of course it’s all paradox, don’t you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the colour, but it’s so typical the way he works it out. It’s the very essence of Wilde, don’t you know. The light touch.
His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe. Tame essence of Wilde.
You’re darned witty. Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasy’s ducats.
How much did I spend? O, a few shillings.
For a plump of pressmen. Humour wet and dry.
Wit. You would give your five wits for youth’s proud livery he pranks in. Lineaments of gratified desire.
There be many mo. Take her for me. In pairing time. Jove, a cool ruttime send them. Yea, turtledove her.
Eve. Naked wheatbellied sin. A snake coils her, fang in’s kiss.
—Do you think it is only a paradox? the quaker librarian was asking. The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.
They talked seriously of mocker’s seriousness.
Buck Mulligan’s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, his head wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. His mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.
—Telegram! he said. Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!
He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:
—The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done. Signed: Dedalus. Where did you launch it from? The kips? No. College Green. Have you drunk the four quid? The aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father. Telegram! Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street. O, you peerless mummer! O, you priestified Kinchite!
Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a querulous brogue:
—It’s what I’m telling you, mister honey, it’s queer and sick we were, Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in. ’Twas murmur we did for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I’m thinking, and he limp with leching.

Stephen laughed.
Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.
—The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you. He heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. He’s out in pampooties to murder you.
—Me! Stephen exclaimed. That was your contribution to literature.
Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling.

—There’s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and offering a card. From the Freeman. He wants to see the files of the Kilkenny People for last year.
—Certainly, certainly, certainly. Is the gentleman?...
He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked, asked, creaked, asked:
—Is he?... O, there!
Brisk in a galliard he was off, out. In the daylit corridor he talked with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most honest broadbrim.

Voluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing dark figure following his hasty heels.
The door closed.
—The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.
He jumped up and snatched the card.
—What’s his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom.
He rattled on:
—Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. I found him over in the museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. The Greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer. Every day we must do homage to her. Life of life, thy lips enkindle.
Suddenly he turned to Stephen:

"For the main plot we have no direct source. It represents, however, Jonson’s typical method. It has been pointed out([53]) that the characteristic Jonsonian comedy always consists of two groups, the intriguers and the victims. In The Devil is an Ass the most purely comic motive of the play is furnished by a reversal of the usual relation subsisting between these two groups. Here the devil, who was wont to be looked upon as arch-intriguer, is constantly ‘fooled off and beaten’, and thus takes his position as the comic butt. Pug, in a sense, represents a satirical trend. Through him Jonson satirizes the outgrown supernaturalism which still clung to the skirts [xlii]of Jacobean realism, and at the same time paints in lively colors the vice of a society against which hell itself is powerless to contend. It is only, however, in a general way, where the devil stands for a principle, that Pug may be considered as in any degree satirical. In the particular incident he is always a purely comic figure, and furnishes the mirth which results from a sense of the incongruity between anticipation and accomplishment.
Fitzdottrel, on the other hand, is mainly satirical. Through him Jonson passes censure upon the city gallant, the attendant at the theatre, the victim of the prevalent superstitions, and even the pretended demoniac. His dupery, as in the case of his bargain with Wittipol, excites indignation rather than mirth, and his final discomfiture affords us almost a sense of poetic justice. This character stands in the position of chief victim.
In an intermediate position are Merecraft and Everill. They succeed in swindling Fitzdottrel and Lady Tailbush, but are in turn played upon by the chief intriguer, Wittipol, with his friend Manly. Jonson’s moral purpose is here plainly visible, especially in contrast to Plautus, with whom the youthful intriguer is also the stock figure. The motive of the young man’s trickery in the Latin comedy is usually unworthy and selfish. That of Wittipol, on the other hand, is wholly disinterested, since he is represented as having already philosophically accepted the rejection of his advances at the hands of Mrs. Fitzdottrel.
In construction the play suffers from overabundance of material. Instead of a single main line of action, which is given clear precedence, there is rather a succession of elaborated episodes, carefully connected and motivated, but not properly subordinated. The plot is coherent and intricate rather than unified. This is further aggravated by the fact that the chief objects of satire are imperfectly understood by readers of the present day.
Jonson observes unity of time, Pug coming to earth in the morning and returning at midnight. With the exception [xliii]of the first scene, which is indeterminate, and seems at one moment to be hell, and the next London, the action is confined to the City, but hovers between Lincoln’s Inn, Newgate, and the house of Lady Tailbush. Unity of action is of course broken by the interference of the devil-plot and the episodic nature of the satirical plot. The main lines of action may be discussed separately.
In the first act chief prominence is given to the intrigue between Wittipol and Mrs. Fitzdottrel. This interest is continued through the second act, but practically dropped after this point. In Act 4 we find that both lovers have recovered from their infatuation, and the intrigue ends by mutual consent.
The second act opens with the episode of Merecraft’s plot to gull Fitzdottrel. The project of the dukedom of Drownedland is given chief place, and attention is centred upon it both here and in the following scenes. Little use, however, is made of it in the motivation of action. This is left for another project, the office of the Master of Dependencies (quarrels) in the next act. This device is introduced in an incidental way, and we are not prepared for the important place which it takes in the development of the plot. Merecraft, goaded by Everill, hits upon it merely as a temporary makeshift to extort money from Fitzdottrel. The latter determines to make use of the office in prosecuting his quarrel with Wittipol. In preparation for the duel, and in accordance with the course of procedure laid down by Everill, he resolves to settle his estate. Merecraft and Everill endeavor to have the deed drawn in their own favor, but through the interference of Wittipol the whole estate is made over to Manly, who restores it to Mrs. Fitzdottrel. This project becomes then the real turning-point of the play.
The episode of Guilthead and Plutarchus in Act 3 is only slightly connected with the main plot. That of Wittipol’s disguise as a Spanish lady, touched upon in the first two acts, becomes the chief [xliv]interest of the fourth. It furnishes much comic material, and the characters of Lady Tailbush and Lady Eitherside offer the poet the opportunity for some of his cleverest touches in characterization and contrast.([54]) The scene, however, is introduced for incidental purposes, the satirization of foreign fashions and the follies of London society, and is overelaborated. The catalogue of cosmetics is an instance of Jonson’s intimate acquaintance with recondite knowledge standing in the way of his art.
Merecraft’s ‘after game’ in the fifth act is of the nature of an appendix. The play might well have ended with the frustration of his plan to get possession of the estate. This act is introduced chiefly for the sake of a satire upon pretended demoniacs and witch-finders. It also contains the conclusion of the devil-plot.
The Devil is an Ass will always remain valuable as a historical document, and as a record of Jonson’s own attitude towards the abuses of his times. In the treatment of Fitzdottrel and Merecraft among the chief persons, and of Plutarchus Guilthead among the lesser, this play belongs to Jonson’s character-drama.([55]) It does not, however, belong to the pure humor-comedy. Like The Alchemist, and in marked contrast to Every Man out of his Humor, interest is sought in plot development. In the scene between Lady Tailbush and Lady Eitherside, the play becomes a comedy of manners, and in its attack upon state abuses it is semi-political in nature. Both Gifford and Swinburne have observed the ethical treatment of the main motives.
With the exception of Prologue and Epilogue, the doggerel couplets spoken by Iniquity, Wittipol’s song (2. 6. 94), and some of the lines quoted by Fitzdottrel in the last scene, the play is written in blank verse throughout. Occasional lines of eight (2. 2. 122), nine (2. 1. 1), [xlv]twelve (1. 1. 33) or thirteen (1. 1. 113) syllables are introduced. Most of these could easily be normalized by a slight emendation or the slurring of a syllable in pronunciation. Many of the lines, however, are rough and difficult of scansion. Most of the dialogue is vigorous, though Wittipol’s language is sometimes affected and unnatural (cf. Act 1. Sc. 1). His speech, 1. 6. 111-148, is classical in tone, but fragmentary and not perfectly assimilated. The song already referred to possesses delicacy and some beauty of imagery, but lacks Jonson’s customary polish and smoothness.
As a work of art the play must rely chiefly upon the vigor of its satiric dialogue and the cleverness of its character sketches. It lacks the chief excellences of construction—unity of interest, subordination of detail, steady and uninterrupted development, and prompt conclusion.",这些独特的饮食习惯和口味偏好如画卷般在中国各地展开，丰富多样的美食文化展示了各地人民多样的生活方式和朴素的饮食智慧。每一道独特的地方菜肴背后，都有着一段历史沉淀和岁月变迁的故事。不同味道的交织碰撞，最终汇聚成当下中国饮食文化的璀璨星光。,易,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"The passage provides an analysis of Ben Jonson's play 'The Devil is an Ass,' highlighting its deviation from Jonson's typical comedy structure. Typically, Jonson's comedies involve two groups: intriguers and victims. In this play, however, the devil (traditionally an arch-intriguer) becomes a comic figure and victim, while Fitzdottrel serves as the main satirical target, embodying societal vices and superstitions. Merecraft and Everill are intermediary characters who manage to swindle Fitzdottrel but are outplayed by Wittipol and Manly. The play's construction is criticized for its overabundance of material and episodes that are not well subordinated, leading to a lack of unity. Various plot episodes focus on different characters and themes, such as swindling and societal satire, with the plot's turning point being the transfer of Fitzdottrel’s estate. The play includes elements of both comedy of manners and semi-political satire. It is majorly written in blank verse but includes various metrical irregularities and occasional singsong couplets. Despite its construction flaws, the play is noted for its vigorous satiric dialogue and clever character sketches.",1230

Instead of a single main line of action, which is given clear precedence, there is rather a succession of elaborated episodes, carefully connected and motivated, but not properly subordinated. The plot is coherent and intricate rather than unified. This is further aggravated by the fact that the chief objects of satire are imperfectly understood by readers of the present day.
Jonson observes unity of time, Pug coming to earth in the morning and returning at midnight. With the exception [xliii]of the first scene, which is indeterminate, and seems at one moment to be hell, and the next London, the action is confined to the City, but hovers between Lincoln’s Inn, Newgate, and the house of Lady Tailbush. Unity of action is of course broken by the interference of the devil-plot and the episodic nature of the satirical plot. The main lines of action may be discussed separately.
In the first act chief prominence is given to the intrigue between Wittipol and Mrs. Fitzdottrel. This interest is continued through the second act, but practically dropped after this point. In Act 4 we find that both lovers have recovered from their infatuation, and the intrigue ends by mutual consent.
The second act opens with the episode of Merecraft’s plot to gull Fitzdottrel. The project of the dukedom of Drownedland is given chief place, and attention is centred upon it both here and in the following scenes. Little use, however, is made of it in the motivation of action. This is left for another project, the office of the Master of Dependencies (quarrels) in the next act. This device is introduced in an incidental way, and we are not prepared for the important place which it takes in the development of the plot. Merecraft, goaded by Everill, hits upon it merely as a temporary makeshift to extort money from Fitzdottrel. The latter determines to make use of the office in prosecuting his quarrel with Wittipol. In preparation for the duel, and in accordance with the course of procedure laid down by Everill, he resolves to settle his estate. Merecraft and Everill endeavor to have the deed drawn in their own favor, but through the interference of Wittipol the whole estate is made over to Manly, who restores it to Mrs. Fitzdottrel. This project becomes then the real turning-point of the play.
The episode of Guilthead and Plutarchus in Act 3 is only slightly connected with the main plot. That of Wittipol’s disguise as a Spanish lady, touched upon in the first two acts, becomes the chief [xliv]interest of the fourth. It furnishes much comic material, and the characters of Lady Tailbush and Lady Eitherside offer the poet the opportunity for some of his cleverest touches in characterization and contrast.([54]) The scene, however, is introduced for incidental purposes, the satirization of foreign fashions and the follies of London society, and is overelaborated. The catalogue of cosmetics is an instance of Jonson’s intimate acquaintance with recondite knowledge standing in the way of his art.
Merecraft’s ‘after game’ in the fifth act is of the nature of an appendix. The play might well have ended with the frustration of his plan to get possession of the estate. This act is introduced chiefly for the sake of a satire upon pretended demoniacs and witch-finders. It also contains the conclusion of the devil-plot.
The Devil is an Ass will always remain valuable as a historical document, and as a record of Jonson’s own attitude towards the abuses of his times. In the treatment of Fitzdottrel and Merecraft among the chief persons, and of Plutarchus Guilthead among the lesser, this play belongs to Jonson’s character-drama.([55]) It does not, however, belong to the pure humor-comedy. Like The Alchemist, and in marked contrast to Every Man out of his Humor, interest is sought in plot development. In the scene between Lady Tailbush and Lady Eitherside, the play becomes a comedy of manners, and in its attack upon state abuses it is semi-political in nature. Both Gifford and Swinburne have observed the ethical treatment of the main motives.
With the exception of Prologue and Epilogue, the doggerel couplets spoken by Iniquity, Wittipol’s song (2. 6. 94), and some of the lines quoted by Fitzdottrel in the last scene, the play is written in blank verse throughout. Occasional lines of eight (2. 2. 122), nine (2. 1. 1), [xlv]twelve (1. 1. 33) or thirteen (1. 1. 113) syllables are introduced. Most of these could easily be normalized by a slight emendation or the slurring of a syllable in pronunciation. Many of the lines, however, are rough and difficult of scansion. Most of the dialogue is vigorous, though Wittipol’s language is sometimes affected and unnatural (cf. Act 1. Sc. 1). His speech, 1. 6. 111-148, is classical in tone, but fragmentary and not perfectly assimilated. The song already referred to possesses delicacy and some beauty of imagery, but lacks Jonson’s customary polish and smoothness.
As a work of art the play must rely chiefly upon the vigor of its satiric dialogue and the cleverness of its character sketches. It lacks the chief excellences of construction—unity of interest, subordination of detail, steady and uninterrupted development, and prompt conclusion.",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"The passage provides an analysis of Ben Jonson's play 'The Devil is an Ass,' highlighting its deviation from Jonson's typical comedy structure.

"For the main plot we have no direct source. It represents, however, Jonson’s typical method. It has been pointed out([53]) that the characteristic Jonsonian comedy always consists of two groups, the intriguers and the victims. In The Devil is an Ass the most purely comic motive of the play is furnished by a reversal of the usual relation subsisting between these two groups. Here the devil, who was wont to be looked upon as arch-intriguer, is constantly ‘fooled off and beaten’, and thus takes his position as the comic butt. Pug, in a sense, represents a satirical trend. Through him Jonson satirizes the outgrown supernaturalism which still clung to the skirts [xlii]of Jacobean realism, and at the same time paints in lively colors the vice of a society against which hell itself is powerless to contend. It is only, however, in a general way, where the devil stands for a principle, that Pug may be considered as in any degree satirical. In the particular incident he is always a purely comic figure, and furnishes the mirth which results from a sense of the incongruity between anticipation and accomplishment.
Fitzdottrel, on the other hand, is mainly satirical. Through him Jonson passes censure upon the city gallant, the attendant at the theatre, the victim of the prevalent superstitions, and even the pretended demoniac. His dupery, as in the case of his bargain with Wittipol, excites indignation rather than mirth, and his final discomfiture affords us almost a sense of poetic justice. This character stands in the position of chief victim.
In an intermediate position are Merecraft and Everill. They succeed in swindling Fitzdottrel and Lady Tailbush, but are in turn played upon by the chief intriguer, Wittipol, with his friend Manly. Jonson’s moral purpose is here plainly visible, especially in contrast to Plautus, with whom the youthful intriguer is also the stock figure. The motive of the young man’s trickery in the Latin comedy is usually unworthy and selfish. That of Wittipol, on the other hand, is wholly disinterested, since he is represented as having already philosophically accepted the rejection of his advances at the hands of Mrs. Fitzdottrel.

"My God, how it has all ended! What it has all ended in! I arrived at nine o'clock. She was already there. I noticed her a good way off; she was standing as she had been that first time, with her elbows on the railing, and she did not hear me coming up to her.
""Nastenka!"" I called to her, suppressing my agitation with an effort.
She turned to me quickly.
""Well?"" she said. ""Well? Make haste!""
I looked at her in perplexity.
""Well, where is the letter? Have you brought the letter?"" she repeated clutching at the railing.
""No, there is no letter,"" I said at last. ""Hasn't he been to you yet?"" She turned fearfully pale and looked at me for a long time without moving. I had shattered her last hope.
""Well, God be with him,"" she said at last in a breaking voice; ""God be with him if he leaves me like that.""
She dropped her eyes, then tried to look at me and could not. For several minutes she was struggling with her emotion. All at once she turned away, leaning her elbows against the railing and burst into tears.
""Oh don't, don't!"" I began; but looking at her I had not the heart to go on, and what was I to say to her?
""Don't try and comfort me,"" she said; ""don't talk about him; don't tell me that he will come, that he has not cast me off so cruelly and so inhumanly as he has. What for—what for? Can there have been something in my letter, that unlucky letter?""
At that point sobs stifled her voice; my heart was torn as I looked at her.
""Oh, how inhumanly cruel it is!"" she began again. ""And not a line, not a line! He might at least have written that he does not want me, that he rejects me—but not a line for three days! How easy it is for him to wound, to insult a poor, defenceless girl, whose only fault is that she loves him! Oh, what I've suffered during these three days! Oh, dear! When I think that I was the first to go to him, that I humbled myself before him, cried, that I begged of him a little love!... and after that! Listen,"" she said, turning to me, and her black eyes flashed, ""it isn't so! It can't be so; it isn't natural. Either you are mistaken or I; perhaps he has not received the letter? Perhaps he still knows nothing about it? How could any one—judge for yourself, tell me, for goodness' sake explain it to me, I can't understand it—how could any one behave with such barbarous coarseness as he has behaved to me? Not one word! Why, the lowest creature on earth is treated more compassionately. Perhaps he has heard something, perhaps some one has told him something about me,"" she cried, turning to me inquiringly: ""What do you think?""
""Listen, Nastenka, I shall go to him to-morrow in your name.""
""Yes?""
""I will question him about everything; I will tell him everything.""
""Yes, yes?""
""You write a letter. Don't say no, Nastenka, don't say no! I will make him respect your action, he shall hear all about it, and if——""
""No, my friend, no,"" she interrupted. ""Enough! Not another word, not another line from me—enough! I don't know him; I don't love him any more. I will ... forget him.""
She could not go on.
""Calm yourself, calm yourself! Sit here, Nastenka,"" I said, making her sit down on the seat.
""I am calm. Don't trouble. It's nothing! It's only tears, they will soon dry. Why, do you imagine I shall do away with myself, that I shall throw myself into the river?""
My heart was full: I tried to speak, but I could not.
""Listen,"" she said taking my hand. ""Tell me: you wouldn't have behaved like this, would you? You would not have abandoned a girl who had come to you of herself, you would not have thrown into her face a shameless taunt at her weak foolish heart? You would have taken care of her? You would have realized that she was alone, that she did not know how to look after herself, that she could not guard herself from loving you, that it was not her fault, not her fault—that she had done nothing.... Oh dear, oh dear!""
""Nastenka!"" I cried at last, unable to control my emotion. ""Nastenka, you torture me! You wound my heart, you are killing me, Nastenka! I cannot be silent! I must speak at last, give utterance to what is surging in my heart!""
As I said this I got up from the seat. She took my hand and looked at me in surprise.
""What is the matter with you?"" she said at last.
""Listen,"" I said resolutely. ""Listen to me, Nastenka! What I am going to say to you now is all nonsense, all impossible, all stupid! I know that this can never be, but I cannot be silent. For the sake of what you are suffering now, I beg you beforehand to forgive me!""
""What is it? What is it?"" she said drying her tears and looking at me intently, while a strange curiosity gleamed in her astonished eyes. ""What is the matter?""
""It's impossible, but I love you, Nastenka! There it is! Now everything is told,"" I said with a wave of my hand. ""Now you will see whether you can go on talking to me as you did just now, whether you can listen to what I am going to say to you.""...
""Well, what then?"" Nastenka interrupted me. ""What of it? I knew you loved me long ago, only I always thought that you simply liked me very much.... Oh dear, oh dear!""
""At first it was simply liking, Nastenka, but now, now! I am just in the same position as you were when you went to him with your bundle. In a worse position than you, Nastenka, because he cared for no one else as you do.""
""What are you saying to me! I don't understand you in the least. But tell me, what's this for; I don't mean what for, but why are you ... so suddenly.... Oh dear, I am talking nonsense! But you....""
And Nastenka broke off in confusion. Her cheeks flamed; she dropped her eyes.
""What's to be done, Nastenka, what am I to do? I am to blame. I have abused your.... But no, no, I am not to blame, Nastenka; I feel that, I know that, because my heart tells me I am right, for I cannot hurt you in any way, I cannot wound you! I was your friend, but I am still your friend, I have betrayed no trust. Here my tears are falling, Nastenka. Let them flow, let them flow—they don't hurt anybody. They will dry, Nastenka.""

"My God, how it has all ended! What it has all ended in! I arrived at nine o'clock. She was already there. I noticed her a good way off; she was standing as she had been that first time, with her elbows on the railing, and she did not hear me coming up to her.
""Nastenka!"" I called to her, suppressing my agitation with an effort.
She turned to me quickly.
""Well?"" she said. ""Well? Make haste!""
I looked at her in perplexity.
""Well, where is the letter? Have you brought the letter?"" she repeated clutching at the railing.
""No, there is no letter,"" I said at last. ""Hasn't he been to you yet?"" She turned fearfully pale and looked at me for a long time without moving. I had shattered her last hope.
""Well, God be with him,"" she said at last in a breaking voice; ""God be with him if he leaves me like that.""
She dropped her eyes, then tried to look at me and could not. For several minutes she was struggling with her emotion. All at once she turned away, leaning her elbows against the railing and burst into tears.
""Oh don't, don't!"" I began; but looking at her I had not the heart to go on, and what was I to say to her?
""Don't try and comfort me,"" she said; ""don't talk about him; don't tell me that he will come, that he has not cast me off so cruelly and so inhumanly as he has. What for—what for? Can there have been something in my letter, that unlucky letter?""
At that point sobs stifled her voice; my heart was torn as I looked at her.
""Oh, how inhumanly cruel it is!"" she began again. ""And not a line, not a line! He might at least have written that he does not want me, that he rejects me—but not a line for three days! How easy it is for him to wound, to insult a poor, defenceless girl, whose only fault is that she loves him! Oh, what I've suffered during these three days! Oh, dear! When I think that I was the first to go to him, that I humbled myself before him, cried, that I begged of him a little love!... and after that! Listen,"" she said, turning to me, and her black eyes flashed, ""it isn't so! It can't be so; it isn't natural. Either you are mistaken or I; perhaps he has not received the letter? Perhaps he still knows nothing about it? How could any one—judge for yourself, tell me, for goodness' sake explain it to me, I can't understand it—how could any one behave with such barbarous coarseness as he has behaved to me? Not one word! Why, the lowest creature on earth is treated more compassionately. Perhaps he has heard something, perhaps some one has told him something about me,"" she cried, turning to me inquiringly: ""What do you think?""
""Listen, Nastenka, I shall go to him to-morrow in your name.""
""Yes?""
""I will question him about everything; I will tell him everything.""
""Yes, yes?""
""You write a letter. Don't say no, Nastenka, don't say no! I will make him respect your action, he shall hear all about it, and if——""
""No, my friend, no,"" she interrupted. ""Enough! Not another word, not another line from me—enough! I don't know him; I don't love him any more. I will ... forget him.""
She could not go on.
""Calm yourself, calm yourself! Sit here, Nastenka,"" I said, making her sit down on the seat.
""I am calm. Don't trouble. It's nothing! It's only tears, they will soon dry. Why, do you imagine I shall do away with myself, that I shall throw myself into the river?""
My heart was full: I tried to speak, but I could not.
""Listen,"" she said taking my hand. ""Tell me: you wouldn't have behaved like this, would you? You would not have abandoned a girl who had come to you of herself, you would not have thrown into her face a shameless taunt at her weak foolish heart? You would have taken care of her? You would have realized that she was alone, that she did not know how to look after herself, that she could not guard herself from loving you, that it was not her fault, not her fault—that she had done nothing.... Oh dear, oh dear!""
""Nastenka!"" I cried at last, unable to control my emotion. ""Nastenka, you torture me! You wound my heart, you are killing me, Nastenka! I cannot be silent! I must speak at last, give utterance to what is surging in my heart!""
As I said this I got up from the seat. She took my hand and looked at me in surprise.
""What is the matter with you?"" she said at last.
""Listen,"" I said resolutely. ""Listen to me, Nastenka! What I am going to say to you now is all nonsense, all impossible, all stupid! I know that this can never be, but I cannot be silent. For the sake of what you are suffering now, I beg you beforehand to forgive me!""
""What is it? What is it?"" she said drying her tears and looking at me intently, while a strange curiosity gleamed in her astonished eyes. ""What is the matter?""
""It's impossible, but I love you, Nastenka! There it is! Now everything is told,"" I said with a wave of my hand. ""Now you will see whether you can go on talking to me as you did just now, whether you can listen to what I am going to say to you.""...
""Well, what then?"" Nastenka interrupted me. ""What of it? I knew you loved me long ago, only I always thought that you simply liked me very much.... Oh dear, oh dear!""
""At first it was simply liking, Nastenka, but now, now! I am just in the same position as you were when you went to him with your bundle. In a worse position than you, Nastenka, because he cared for no one else as you do.""
""What are you saying to me! I don't understand you in the least. But tell me, what's this for; I don't mean what for, but why are you ... so suddenly.... Oh dear, I am talking nonsense! But you....""
And Nastenka broke off in confusion. Her cheeks flamed; she dropped her eyes.
""What's to be done, Nastenka, what am I to do? I am to blame. I have abused your.... But no, no, I am not to blame, Nastenka; I feel that, I know that, because my heart tells me I am right, for I cannot hurt you in any way, I cannot wound you! I was your friend, but I am still your friend, I have betrayed no trust. Here my tears are falling, Nastenka. Let them flow, let them flow—they don't hurt anybody. They will dry, Nastenka.""

时六年九月十五日。","滕子京谪居巴陵，心境忧愁，但志向未减，乃有意修葺岳阳楼以示志。楼成之后，子京登楼远眺，见洞庭湖烟波浩渺，波澜壮阔，心中激荡，不禁吐言而吟诗一首。其时，巴陵郡之丰姿雅韵，尽显于斯，岳阳楼之高耸伟岸，辉映湖光山色，气象万千。子京凭栏远望，见天光云影，共湖水一色；苍翠巍峨，与天际齐峻，此所谓天地之大美也。

然而，自霖雨绵绵，滂沱洒洒，湖面风雨交加，天地顿生肃穆，子京心生疑虑。楼高风紧，涛声阵阵如诉，若悲若恸，顿时胸怀黯然，感慨叹息。乃至霭霭白雾弥漫，仿佛天山交接，满楼寂静无声，内有无限落寞。子京望之，心怀不已，叹此景如此，又何堪？

相反，若时值天朗气清，日光灿烂，子京复登是楼，眺望朗朗乾坤，洞庭一碧万顷。此时楼上清风徐来，令人心旷神怡。远山如黛，湖水如镜，天光所映，波光粼粼。目极之处，南山景美，更有百里风帆竞发，江船相会水面，真乃乐哉。

子京既见吾景，复怀吾情，感悟至深。自古以来，仁人志士立志于天下，非只己悲，亦为苍生忧虑，所谓“先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐”正此意也。观今岳阳楼之景，子京未尝不感慨万千，疾呼天下之士，君子当自我砥砺，力行仁义之道，共为苍生济时安民。吾人亦当效是志，共同志成天下，庶几能安黎庶，而遂贤者之志也。",易,GPT-4o,古文学,中文,本文记叙了滕子京被贬谪到巴陵郡后重修岳阳楼的经过，并通过描绘岳阳楼的景色，抒发了作者不同的心境感受。作者先描述了巴陵胜状和岳阳楼的美景，又表达了在阴雨连绵和晴和日光下登楼的不同时候所产生的悲喜情绪。最后作者提出了自己对仁人志士的理解，呼吁读者应有“先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐”的情怀。,491

滕王高阁临江渚，佩玉鸣鸾罢歌舞。
画栋朝飞南浦云，珠帘暮卷西山雨。
闲云潭影日悠悠，物换星移几度秋。
阁中帝子今何在？槛外长江空自流。","唐高宗永徽之时，豫章郡南昌，湛露清晨，滕王阁璀璨辉煌，与江湖山色共一色。南昌古城，以其繁华闻名遐迩，江水悠悠，山影幂幂，缥缈云气弥漫其间。登上滕王阁，俯瞰四周，山水相连，青翠欲滴，美不胜收。阁内重檐飞甍，雕梁画栋，巧夺天工，令人流连忘返。


由阁眺望，赣水东流，渔舟唱晚，白帆点点；滕阁对高，红树青山，秋尽春来。清风徐来，水波不兴，心之所及，悠然自得。梯航远下，最宜天际风月；佳木繁荫，青青子衿。


登斯楼而四望，至若春和景明，万物勃发，唯见滕阁雄峙，群山环抱，如珠翠嵌于江边。兴来以觉身轻，心游目极，揽天地之大美，览江山之奇景，万千感慨涌上心头。


回眸往昔，身世浮沉，王勃自幼才华横溢，文章双甲天下。年少成名，却因命运多舛，仕途坎坷，未得展其才志。然心境高洁，不改初衷，志在青云，立下高远之志。望滕阁而感叹，世事无常，不禁长叹时运不济。观景自哀，叹己之零落，然而心中不改其志，仍持淡泊宁静之心，向往仕界，为黎民谋福祉。


滕王阁上，心怀坦荡，意气风发，虽不在朝，却恪守仁德，志存高远。仰瞻天宇，高风亮节；俯察江云，心旷神怡。上追古贤，下观百姓，心怀天下，志在四方。江南美景，虽善变幻，然人心不移，若竹柏常青，四时长长。


时至晌午，日影晖晖，余辉洒满滕阁，犹如披锦戴玉，光彩夺目。临近江岸，鹭鸟翩飞，白云悠荡，与天际接连一苍茫。遥观此景，身心豁然，思绪无限，虽身在俗世，心已远游。


王勃笔随心动，画卷展开，心之所感，挥洒笔端。临此壮美之境，感叹道：“神州万里，山河壮丽，何以此区区之地，便如此之美！”继而叹道：“世间事无常，何必计较功过荣辱，唯有高洁之志，宏远之心，方可立于天地之间。”


滕王阁景，行人留影，文人骚客，皆在此地吟誦咏叹，共赏时光之美。江山如画，浩气长存，忽闻远处乐声袅袅，然则一曲千愁尽销，心中留一片光明。身虽困于凡尘，然胸怀天下，志向未来。

地中有亭，名醉翁亭。亭中饮酒作乐之人，皆为名士。太守欧阳修，号称醉翁，然其心实不在酒，而在美景之中。每至春秋佳日，欧阳修与众宾客相聚于此，举杯畅饮，谈笑风生，其乐无穷。

四时之景，各有千秋。春日，百花齐放，山花烂漫，蜂蝶飞舞，人们踏青游赏，欢声笑语。夏日，绿荫如盖，流水潺潺，鸟语花香，众人徜徉其间，避暑纳凉。秋日，层林尽染，枫叶红艳，凉风习习，游客漫步山林，品味秋意。冬日，白雪皑皑，银装素裹，天地一色，有怀古之士，登高远眺，抒发胸臆。

欧阳修与宾客，于醉翁亭中，席地而坐，觞筹交错。美酒盈觞，欢声笑语，洋溢四方。或垂钓于溪边，或纵情山水之间，皆忘却尘世之烦忧，沉醉于自然之乐。欧阳修一边饮酒，一边环顾四周，自然美景尽收眼底。其笔疾书不停，将所见所闻，所感所悟，尽皆记录于文中。

是故无冥冥之志者，无昭昭之明；无惛惛之事者，无赫赫之功。行衢道者不至，事两君者不容。目不能两视而明，耳不能两听而聪。螣蛇无足而飞，鼫鼠五技而穷。《诗》曰：“尸鸠在桑，其子七兮。淑人君子，其仪一兮。其仪一兮，心如结兮！”故君子结于一也。
昔者瓠巴鼓瑟，而流鱼出听；伯牙鼓琴，而六马仰秣。故声无小而不闻，行无隐而不形 。玉在山而草木润，渊生珠而崖不枯。为善不积邪？安有不闻者乎？
学恶乎始？恶乎终？曰：其数则始乎诵经，终乎读礼；其义则始乎为士，终乎为圣人， 真积力久则入，学至乎没而后止也。故学数有终，若其义则不可须臾舍也。为之，人也；舍 之，禽兽也。故书者，政事之纪也；诗者，中声之所止也；礼者，法之大分，类之纲纪也。 故学至乎礼而止矣。夫是之谓道德之极。礼之敬文也，乐之中和也，诗书之博也，春秋之微 也，在天地之间者毕矣。
君子之学也，入乎耳，箸乎心，布乎四体，形乎动静。端而言，蝡而动，一可以为法则。小人之学也，入乎耳，出乎口；口耳之间，则四寸耳，曷足以美七尺之躯哉！古之学者为己，今之学者为人。君子之学也，以美其身；小人之学也，以为禽犊。故不问而告谓之傲，问一而告二谓之囋。傲、非也，囋、非也；君子如向矣。
学莫便乎近其人。礼乐法而不说，诗书故而不切，春秋约而不速。方其人之习君子之说，则尊以遍矣，周于世矣。故曰：学莫便乎近其人。","古之圣贤，皆以学为本，君子所行，莫不由学而成。夫君子好学，慎行以致明智，无误知。譬如良田美池，必待耕种灌溉，方能五谷丰登；又如雕工刻玉，雕琢日久，璞玉方成。是故，君子涉世，若不勤学苦练，何能成德成器哉？

然学问之道，非一日之功，需积累而成。譬若水滴石穿，非一时之力，积小成以成大业。故君子之学，贵在持之以恒，专注一志。若学而弃之，则如篙无舵，晃荡不定，终无所成。孔子曰：“三人行必有我师焉，择其善者而从之，其不善者而改之。”此乃积累小成，终有大成之要义也。

君子之学，在于内化，提升自身素养。譬若篆刻碑文，形化而意在，深思而敏行。若仅表面索学，未得其髓，则如蜀犬吠日，浮浅无根，小人之学亦如是。故君子攬书而内化，储德于心，化行为正。

然则学有法，避傲慢须谨慎。君子切忌因学而自矜，亦戒惧先学之浅薄。孟子曰：“过吾萧墙之外者，其学不必是也。”故学者应虚怀若谷，戒骄戒躁，方成大器。

学之捷径，莫过于亲贤人。亲君子则德修，亲小人则行亏。先贤有言：“近朱者赤，近墨者黑。”亲近贤人，如沐春风，陶冶性灵；远离小人，如避炎夏，得以静心。是故，学者必择谦德而亲之，明智而从之，不断进德修业也。

综而言之，君子志在学，慎行以增智，勤勉以成德。积累小成，专注持恒，内化养德，避傲守谦，亲近贤人，此乃学业之要道也。唯有如此，方能于社会中，成为栋梁之才，于天地间，立不朽之丰碑。其道广布，在学者共勉之。",易,GPT-4o,古文学,中文,这段文字从不同角度探讨了学习的重要性和方法。首先，说明了君子不断学习、慎行会变得明智无误，并以多个比喻说明环境和习惯对人的影响。接着，强调积累小成就能最终成就大目标，并指出专注和持之以恒的重要性。此外，还通过对比君子和小人的学习态度，强调君子之学在于内化，以提升自身素养，并警示学者要避免傲慢与浮浅。最后，提到亲近贤人是学习最便捷的路径。,1426

"君子曰：学不可以已。
青，取之于蓝，而青于蓝；冰，水为之，而寒于水。木直中绳，輮以为轮，其曲中规。虽有槁暴，不复挺者，輮使之然也。故木受绳则直，金就砺则利，君子博学而日参省乎己，则知明而行无过矣。
故不登高山，不知天之高也；不临深溪，不知地之厚也；不闻先王之遗言，不知学问之大也。干、越、夷、貉之子，生而同声，长而异俗，教使之然也。诗曰：“嗟尔君子，无恒安息。靖共尔位，好是正直。神之听之，介尔景福。”神莫大于化道，福莫长于无祸。
吾尝终日而思矣，不如须臾之所学也；吾尝跂而望矣，不如登高之博见也。登高而招，臂非加长也，而见者远；顺风而呼，声非加疾也，而闻者彰。假舆马者，非利足也，而致千里；假舟楫者，非能水也，而绝江河。君子生非异也，善假于物也。(君子生 通：性)
南方有鸟焉，名曰蒙鸠，以羽为巢，而编之以发，系之苇苕，风至苕折，卵破子死。巢非不完也，所系者然也。西方有木焉，名曰射干，茎长四寸，生于高山之上，而临百仞之渊，木茎非能长也，所立者然也。蓬生麻中，不扶而直；白沙在涅，与之俱黑。兰槐之根是为芷，其渐之滫，君子不近，庶人不服。其质非不美也，所渐者然也。故君子居必择乡，游必就士，所以防邪辟而近中正也。
物类之起，必有所始。荣辱之来，必象其德。肉腐出虫，鱼枯生蠹。怠慢忘身，祸灾乃作。强自取柱，柔自取束。邪秽在身，怨之所构。施薪若一，火就燥也，平地若一，水就湿也。草木畴生，禽兽群焉，物各从其类也。是故质的张，而弓矢至焉；林木茂，而斧斤至焉；树成荫，而众鸟息焉。醯酸，而蜹聚焉。故言有招祸也，行有招辱也，君子慎其所立乎！
积土成山，风雨兴焉；积水成渊，蛟龙生焉；积善成德，而神明自得，圣心备焉。故不积跬步，无以至千里；不积小流，无以成江海。骐骥一跃，不能十步；驽马十驾，功在不舍。锲而舍之，朽木不折；锲而不舍，金石可镂。蚓无爪牙之利，筋骨之强，上食埃土，下饮黄泉，用心一也。蟹六跪而二螯，非蛇鳝之穴无可寄托者，用心躁也。(江海 一作：江河)
是故无冥冥之志者，无昭昭之明；无惛惛之事者，无赫赫之功。行衢道者不至，事两君者不容。目不能两视而明，耳不能两听而聪。螣蛇无足而飞，鼫鼠五技而穷。《诗》曰：“尸鸠在桑，其子七兮。淑人君子，其仪一兮。其仪一兮，心如结兮！”故君子结于一也。
昔者瓠巴鼓瑟，而流鱼出听；伯牙鼓琴，而六马仰秣。故声无小而不闻，行无隐而不形 。玉在山而草木润，渊生珠而崖不枯。为善不积邪？安有不闻者乎？

"秦孝公据崤函之固，拥雍州之地，君臣固守以窥周室，有席卷天下，包举宇内，囊括四海之意，并吞八荒之心。当是时也，商君佐之，内立法度，务耕织，修守战之具；外连衡而斗诸侯。于是秦人拱手而取西河之外。

孝公既没，惠文、武、昭襄蒙故业，因遗策，南取汉中，西举巴蜀，东割膏腴之地，北收要害之郡。诸侯恐惧，会盟而谋弱秦，不爱珍器重宝肥饶之地，以致天下之士，合从缔交，相与为一。当此之时，齐有孟尝，赵有平原，楚有春申，魏有信陵。此四君者，皆明智而忠信，宽厚而爱人，尊贤而重士，约从离衡，兼韩、魏、燕、楚、齐、赵、宋、卫、中山之众。于是六国之士，有甯越、徐尚、苏秦、杜赫之属为之谋，齐明、周最、陈轸、召滑、楼缓、翟景、苏厉、乐毅之徒通其意，吴起、孙膑、带佗、倪良、王廖、田忌、廉颇、赵奢之伦制其兵。尝以十倍之地，百万之众，叩关而攻秦。秦人开关延敌，九国之师，逡巡而不敢进。秦无亡矢遗镞之费，而天下诸侯已困矣。于是从散约败，争割地而赂秦。秦有余力而制其弊，追亡逐北，伏尸百万，流血漂橹。因利乘便，宰割天下，分裂山河。强国请服，弱国入朝。延及孝文王、庄襄王，享国之日浅，国家无事。

及至始皇，奋六世之余烈，振长策而御宇内，吞二周而亡诸侯，履至尊而制六合，执敲扑而鞭笞天下，威振四海。南取百越之地，以为桂林、象郡；百越之君，俯首系颈，委命下吏。乃使蒙恬北筑长城而守藩篱，却匈奴七百余里。胡人不敢南下而牧马，士不敢弯弓而报怨。于是废先王之道，焚百家之言，以愚黔首；隳名城，杀豪杰，收天下之兵，聚之咸阳，销锋镝，铸以为金人十二，以弱天下之民。然后践华为城，因河为池，据亿丈之城，临不测之渊，以为固。良将劲弩守要害之处，信臣精卒陈利兵而谁何。天下已定，始皇之心，自以为关中之固，金城千里，子孙帝王万世之业也。

始皇既没，余威震于殊俗。然陈涉瓮牖绳枢之子，氓隶之人，而迁徙之徒也；才能不及中人，非有仲尼、墨翟之贤，陶朱、猗顿之富；蹑足行伍之间，而倔起阡陌之中，率疲弊之卒，将数百之众，转而攻秦，斩木为兵，揭竿为旗，天下云集响应，赢粮而景从。山东豪俊遂并起而亡秦族矣。

且夫天下非小弱也，雍州之地，崤函之固，自若也。陈涉之位，非尊于齐、楚、燕、赵、韩、魏、宋、卫、中山之君也；锄櫌棘矜，非铦于钩戟长铩也；谪戍之众，非抗于九国之师也；深谋远虑，行军用兵之道，非及乡时之士也。然而成败异变，功业相反，何也？试使山东之国与陈涉度长絜大，比权量力，则不可同年而语矣。然秦以区区之地，致万乘之势，序八州而朝同列，百有余年矣；然后以六合为家，崤函为宫；一夫作难而七庙隳，身死人手，为天下笑者，何也？仁义不施而攻守之势异也。","战国之世，列国纷争，山河动荡。秦国，居西陲而起，历代孜孜不倦，终成一雄。其兴也，有赖秦孝公之锐志，与商鞅之法度。孝公深谋远虑，誓振秦国；商鞅革故鼎新，变法图强。秦人因之富强，国力日增，疆域广扩，战无不胜，终致六国撼然，天下一统。

秦孝公，即位之初，锐意图治，广听贤才。彼时，商鞅适时而来，献策变法。法令苛严，行之不悔。废井田、行郡县，重农抑商，赏罚分明。其政令一出，廉吏尽职，士民励行。秦国财用具足，民勤力作，军功显著。筑长城以御敌，治水利以农桑，秦国由是而日渐强盛。

及至秦昭襄王之世，秦国已为诸侯所畏。昭襄王又续前政，联合韩、魏以攻楚，连横称雄，遂取六国之地，以为天下一统之基。昭襄王卒，昭襄子孝文王继之，时值嬴政初生。嬴政即后之秦始皇，继位时年少，然其志大，欲一统华夏。

嬴政即位后，励精图治，内除奸佞，外定诸侯。用王翦、蒙恬等名将，横扫六合，灭六国秦雄。彼时，赵、燕、齐、楚、韩、魏六国皆降服，天下归于一统。而始皇之志，不止于此。欲固天下之基，深思熟虑，焚书坑儒，收兵聚武。全国书籍，阅而焚之；四方贤士，废而戮之。其政出于法，不容偏私，民心悸而畏之。

始皇虽有治世之功，却不给仁爱之怀。帝崩之年，二世胡亥继位，政出不仁，怨声载道。时有陈涉，因赋役苛重，率众起义。鸿沟楚汉相争，群盗蜂起，天下大乱。胡亥无身将才，内忧外患，终至秦国覆灭。

作者言秦国之强，非一朝一夕之功。法令苛刻，政令严明，致使百姓勤劳，国力浩荡。然其政虽固，非仁爱之治。焚书坑儒，废贤灭德，愚民甚众，民心离散。秦始皇崩，则厉治骤动；二世承其险政，不谙治国之道。陈涉揭竿而起，天下响应。民心向背，成败由此也。

综上所述，秦国虽强于一世，然其强也，非仁爱而得，乃为苛法所迫。仁义不施，民心叛离；奸佞得势，国本动摇。秦之灭亡，实亦有迹可循。以史为鉴，不可不察焉。",易,GPT-4o,古文学,中文,这段文字概述了战国时期秦国从崛起到灭亡的历史进程。从秦孝公建立强大国力开始，通过商鞅变法和战争扩展疆域，逐步成为强大的国家。秦始皇统一六国后，采取焚书坑儒、收兵聚武等措施以巩固统治。然而，秦始皇死后，陈涉等起义，迅速导致秦朝灭亡。作者分析了秦国虽曾强大，但因仁义不施导致统治最终崩溃的原因。,1009

孝公既没，惠文、武、昭襄蒙故业，因遗策，南取汉中，西举巴蜀，东割膏腴之地，北收要害之郡。诸侯恐惧，会盟而谋弱秦，不爱珍器重宝肥饶之地，以致天下之士，合从缔交，相与为一。当此之时，齐有孟尝，赵有平原，楚有春申，魏有信陵。此四君者，皆明智而忠信，宽厚而爱人，尊贤而重士，约从离衡，兼韩、魏、燕、楚、齐、赵、宋、卫、中山之众。于是六国之士，有甯越、徐尚、苏秦、杜赫之属为之谋，齐明、周最、陈轸、召滑、楼缓、翟景、苏厉、乐毅之徒通其意，吴起、孙膑、带佗、倪良、王廖、田忌、廉颇、赵奢之伦制其兵。尝以十倍之地，百万之众，叩关而攻秦。秦人开关延敌，九国之师，逡巡而不敢进。秦无亡矢遗镞之费，而天下诸侯已困矣。于是从散约败，争割地而赂秦。秦有余力而制其弊，追亡逐北，伏尸百万，流血漂橹。因利乘便，宰割天下，分裂山河。强国请服，弱国入朝。延及孝文王、庄襄王，享国之日浅，国家无事。

及至始皇，奋六世之余烈，振长策而御宇内，吞二周而亡诸侯，履至尊而制六合，执敲扑而鞭笞天下，威振四海。南取百越之地，以为桂林、象郡；百越之君，俯首系颈，委命下吏。乃使蒙恬北筑长城而守藩篱，却匈奴七百余里。胡人不敢南下而牧马，士不敢弯弓而报怨。于是废先王之道，焚百家之言，以愚黔首；隳名城，杀豪杰，收天下之兵，聚之咸阳，销锋镝，铸以为金人十二，以弱天下之民。然后践华为城，因河为池，据亿丈之城，临不测之渊，以为固。良将劲弩守要害之处，信臣精卒陈利兵而谁何。天下已定，始皇之心，自以为关中之固，金城千里，子孙帝王万世之业也。

始皇既没，余威震于殊俗。然陈涉瓮牖绳枢之子，氓隶之人，而迁徙之徒也；才能不及中人，非有仲尼、墨翟之贤，陶朱、猗顿之富；蹑足行伍之间，而倔起阡陌之中，率疲弊之卒，将数百之众，转而攻秦，斩木为兵，揭竿为旗，天下云集响应，赢粮而景从。山东豪俊遂并起而亡秦族矣。

且夫天下非小弱也，雍州之地，崤函之固，自若也。陈涉之位，非尊于齐、楚、燕、赵、韩、魏、宋、卫、中山之君也；锄櫌棘矜，非铦于钩戟长铩也；谪戍之众，非抗于九国之师也；深谋远虑，行军用兵之道，非及乡时之士也。然而成败异变，功业相反，何也？试使山东之国与陈涉度长絜大，比权量力，则不可同年而语矣。然秦以区区之地，致万乘之势，序八州而朝同列，百有余年矣；然后以六合为家，崤函为宫；一夫作难而七庙隳，身死人手，为天下笑者，何也？仁义不施而攻守之势异也。",,,GPT-4o,古文学,中文,这段文字概述了战国时期秦国从崛起到灭亡的历史进程。从秦孝公建立强大国力开始，通过商鞅变法和战争扩展疆域，逐步成为强大的国家。秦始皇统一六国后，采取焚书坑儒、收兵聚武等措施以巩固统治。然而，秦始皇死后，陈涉等起义，迅速导致秦朝灭亡。作者分析了秦国虽曾强大，但因仁义不施导致统治最终崩溃的原因。,1009

"行略定秦地。函谷关有兵守关，不得入。又闻沛公已破咸阳，项羽大怒，使当阳君等击关。项羽遂入，至于戏西。沛公军霸上，未得与项羽相见。沛公左司马曹无伤，使人言于项羽曰：“沛公欲王关中，使子婴为相，珍宝尽有之。”项羽大怒曰：“旦日飨士卒，为击破沛公军！”当是时，项羽兵四十万，在新丰鸿门；沛公兵十万，在霸上。范增说项羽曰：“沛公居山东时，贪于财货，好美姬。今入关，财物无所取，妇女无所幸，此其志不在小。吾令人望其气，皆为龙虎，成五采，此天子气也。急击勿失！”
楚左尹项伯者，项羽季父也，素善留侯张良。张良是时从沛公，项伯乃夜驰之沛公军，私见张良，具告以事，欲呼张良与俱去，曰：“毋从俱死也。”张良曰：“臣为韩王送沛公，沛公今事有急，亡去不义，不可不语。”良乃入，具告沛公。沛公大惊，曰：“为之奈何？”张良曰：“谁为大王为此计者？”曰：“鲰生说我曰：‘距关，毋内诸侯，秦地可尽王也。’故听之。”良曰：“料大王士卒足以当项王乎？”沛公默然，曰：“固不如也。且为之奈何？”张良曰：“请往谓项伯，言沛公不敢背项王也。”沛公曰：“君安与项伯有故？”张良曰：“秦时与臣游，项伯杀人，臣活之。今事有急，故幸来告良。”沛公曰：“孰与君少长？”良曰：“长于臣。”沛公曰：“君为我呼入，吾得兄事之。”张良出，要项伯。项伯即入见沛公。沛公奉卮酒为寿，约为婚姻，曰：“吾入关，秋毫不敢有所近，籍吏民，封府库，而待将军。所以遣将守关者，备他盗之出入与非常也。日夜望将军至，岂敢反乎！愿伯具言臣之不敢倍德也。”项伯许诺，谓沛公曰：“旦日不可不蚤自来谢项王。”沛公曰：“诺。”于是项伯复夜去，至军中，具以沛公言报项王，因言曰：“沛公不先破关中，公岂敢入乎？今人有大功而击之，不义也。不如因善遇之。”项王许诺。
沛公旦日从百余骑来见项王，至鸿门，谢曰：“臣与将军戮力而攻秦，将军战河北，臣战河南，然不自意能先入关破秦，得复见将军于此。今者有小人之言，令将军与臣有郤。”项王曰：“此沛公左司马曹无伤言之。不然，籍何以至此？”项王即日因留沛公与饮。项王、项伯东向坐，亚父南向坐，——亚父者，范增也；沛公北向坐；张良西向侍。范增数目项王，举所佩玉玦以示之者三，项王默然不应。范增起，出，召项庄，谓曰：“君王为人不忍。若入前为寿，寿毕，请以剑舞，因击沛公于坐，杀之。不者，若属皆且为所虏。”庄则入为寿。寿毕，曰：“君王与沛公饮，军中无以为乐，请以剑舞。”项王曰：“诺。”项庄拔剑起舞，项伯亦拔剑起舞，常以身翼蔽沛公，庄不得击。
于是张良至军门见樊哙。樊哙曰：“今日之事何如？”良曰：“甚急！今者项庄拔剑舞，其意常在沛公也。”哙曰：“此迫矣！臣请入，与之同命。”哙即带剑拥盾入军门。交戟之卫士欲止不内，樊哙侧其盾以撞，卫士仆地，哙遂入，披帷西向立，瞋目视项王，头发上指，目眦尽裂。项王按剑而跽曰：“客何为者？”张良曰：“沛公之参乘樊哙者也。”项王曰：“壮士！赐之卮酒。”则与斗卮酒。哙拜谢，起，立而饮之。项王曰：“赐之彘肩。”则与一生彘肩。樊哙覆其盾于地，加彘肩上，拔剑切而啖之。项王曰：“壮士！能复饮乎？”樊哙曰：“臣死且不避，卮酒安足辞！夫秦王有虎狼之心，杀人如不能举，刑人如恐不胜，天下皆叛之。怀王与诸将约曰：‘先破秦入咸阳者王之。’今沛公先破秦入咸阳，毫毛不敢有所近，封闭宫室，还军霸上，以待大王来。故遣将守关者，备他盗出入与非常也。劳苦而功高如此，未有封侯之赏，而听细说，欲诛有功之人，此亡秦之续耳。窃为大王不取也！”项王未有以应，曰：“坐。”樊哙从良坐。坐须臾，沛公起如厕，因招樊哙出。","楚汉相争，烽烟四起。时至鸿门宴，存亡之际，风云骤变。乃听者闻之，皆心惊胆战。

是时，项羽毂满胸中怒气，因闻得沛公欲称王于关中。项羽慨然，怒火如焚。范增设谋，若狂风暴雨，急劝羽曰：“势不可缓，当击杀沛公，一举以决。”羽心动未决，然从谏如流。范增谋甫定，风云煞气直逼沛营。

观沛公营垒，张良夜夜忧心忡忡，不知大劫将至。忽闻帐外有急步声，幕中突现项伯。项伯面色焦急，但不失冷静，告知张良曰：“吾主怒甚，范增欲设计害尔主。吾念往昔之仁义，特来报之，盍速行计。”张良惊骇不已，感项伯慨义，立命请沛公相商。

沛公闻讯，惶惶不安，然素智勇双全，迅疾立计曰：“欲取天下者，不动民心不畏敌，吾当临难先谢罪，言体谅忠孝。”乃复厚礼相谢项伯，恳求引见项羽。项伯允诺，百般劝慰焉。

及至鸿门，天下英杰汇聚，气氛凛冽如刀。项羽坐于高位，目光如电，扫视满堂，异乎平日威武。范增立于其旁，杀机潜隐。沛公步入堂中，谦辞斐然，屈膝谢过，言辞懇切，意在表誠。

饮酌之间，项庄请舞于堂，持剑而上，其意昭然。张良心知其谋，面色变苦。忠义之士项伯见之，连步上前，与项庄相对，剑光交锋，舞姿凛冽以阻之。

项伯勇敢制衡，掩饰敌意，然范增眉头紧锁，心急如焚，暗对项庄耳语，命其再襲。正此之际，樊哙冲入堂，声如雷霆，慷慨陈词，言沛公受汉怀柔，无意背叛。其言真诚，震慑全场。

项羽虽心有疑惧，然察樊哙慷慨豪气，不忍逼人太甚。且忆旧情，心生数分怜悯，不忍痛下杀手。范增无奈，眉头紧锁义无反顾，犹深一言却无谋。

宴会终，项羽罢兵，各归其席。沛公乃捧誠归去，心惊但得释怀。一旦返回营中，举措急分领兵，未敢稍懈。

是役，沛公智勇兼备，项羽豪情篡 权。若论兵者，虽险中脱生，一时风光，终曰难测。鸿门宴毕，天下大局未定，罡风又起，风涛紧接旧。寒江夜过影，铁马秋风动，英雄迟暮，无计长江东流水。",易,GPT-4o,古文学,中文,这段文字讲述了楚汉战争中的鸿门宴事件：项羽得知沛公意图称王关中后非常愤怒，范增建议迅速击杀沛公。项伯夜访沛公军营，告知张良并建议沛公前去向项羽谢罪。沛公与项羽见面时，项庄借剑舞之机试图刺杀沛公，但被项伯阻止。樊哙勇敢应对，表示沛公无意反叛，最终项羽并未采取行动，沛公成功逃脱险境。,1483

"陈王初立时，陵人秦嘉﹑铚人董譄﹑符离人朱鸡石﹑取虑人郑布﹑徐人丁疾等皆特起，将兵围东海守庆于郯。陈王闻，乃使武平君畔为将军，监郯下军。秦嘉不受命，嘉自立为大司马，恶属武平君。告军吏曰：“武平君年少，不知兵事，勿听！”因矫以王命杀武平君畔。

章邯已破伍徐，击陈，柱国房君死。章邯又进兵击陈西张贺军。陈王出监战，军破，张贺死。

腊月，陈王之汝阴，还至下城父，其御庄贾杀以降秦。陈胜葬砀，谥曰隐王。

陈王故涓人将军吕臣为仓头军，起新阳，攻陈下之，杀庄贾，复以陈为楚。

初，陈王至陈，令铚人宋留将兵定南阳，入武关。留已徇南阳，闻陈王死，南阳复为秦。宋留不能入武关，乃东至新蔡，遇秦军，宋留以军降秦。秦传留至咸阳，车裂留以徇。

秦嘉等闻陈王军破出走，乃立景驹为楚王，引兵之方与，欲击秦军定陶下。使公孙庆使齐王，欲与并力俱进。齐王曰：“闻陈王战败，不知其死生，楚安得不请而立王！”公孙庆曰：“齐不请楚而立王，楚何故请齐而立王！且楚首事，当令于天下。”田儋诛杀公孙庆。

秦左右校复攻陈，下之。吕将军走，收兵复聚。鄱盗当阳君黥布之兵相收，复击秦左右校，破之青波，复以陈为楚。会项梁立怀王孙心为楚王。

陈胜王凡六月。已为王，王陈。其故人尝与佣耕者闻之，之陈，扣宫门曰：“吾欲见涉。”宫门令欲缚之。自辩数，乃置，不肯为通。陈王出，遮道而呼涉。陈王闻之，乃召见，载与俱归。入宫，见殿屋帷帐，客曰：“夥颐！涉之为王沉沉者！”楚人谓多为伙，故天下传之，夥涉为王，由陈涉始。客出入愈益发舒，言陈王故情。或说陈王曰：“客愚无知，颛妄言，轻威。”陈王斩之。诸陈王故人皆自引去，由是无亲陈王者。陈王以朱房为中正，胡武为司过，主司群臣。诸将徇地，至，令之不是者，系而罪之，以苛察为忠。其所不善者，弗下吏，辄自治之。陈王信用之。诸将以其故不亲附，此其所以败也。

陈胜虽已死，其所置遣侯王将相竟亡秦，由涉首事也。高祖时为陈涉置守頉三十家砀，至今血食。

褚先生曰：地形险阻，所以为固也；兵革刑法，所以为治也。犹未足恃也。夫先王以仁义为本，而以固塞文法为枝叶，岂不然哉！吾闻贾生之称曰：

“秦孝公据肴函之固，拥雍州之地，君臣固守，以窥周室，有席卷天下、包举宇内、囊括四海之意，并吞八荒之心。当是时也，商君佐之，内立法度，务耕织，修守战之具；外连衡而斗诸侯。于是秦人拱手而取西河之外。

“孝公既没，惠文、武、昭襄蒙故业因遗策，南取汉中，西举巴蜀，东割膏腴之地，收要害之郡。诸侯恐惧，会盟而谋弱秦，不爱珍器、重宝、肥饶之地，以致天下之士，合从缔交，相与为一。当此之时，齐有孟尝，赵有平原，楚有春申，魏有信陵。此四君者，皆明智而忠信，宽厚而爱人，尊贤而重士，约从离横，兼韩、魏、燕、赵、宋、卫、中山之众。于是六国之士，有宁越、徐尚、苏秦、杜赫之属为之谋，齐明、周最、陈轸、召滑、楼缓、翟景、苏厉、乐毅之徒通其意，吴起、孙膑、带佗、倪良、王廖、田忌、廉颇、赵奢之伦制其兵。尝以十倍之地，百万之众，叩关而攻秦。秦人开关而延敌，九国之师逡巡遁逃而不敢进。秦无亡矢遗镞之费，而天下诸侯已困矣。于是从散约解，争割地以赂秦。秦有余力而制其弊，追亡逐北，伏尸百万，流血飘橹。因利乘便，宰割天下，分裂河山。强国请服，弱国入朝。

风檐展书读，古道照颜色。","北庭土室，暗无天日，尘埃遍布，污秽难言。斯间形拮，夏日炎炎，无处躲藏，困厄中人，葳蕤毒气，侵入肺腑。身遭狐卤，心内焦虑，哀哉，我命何其微乎！然则抚心自问，犹自宽慰，手握毫端，寄情笔端，信然我身犹恃浩然之气也。

岂不知此浩然之气，乃天地之间正气乎？其本根悠远，自太初已始，包罗万象，荡涤邪秽，俯仰无愧。先有古之烈士，凛然生存于正气之中，如孟尝君之士田单，其智计百出，勇而多谋，皆足证此正气之伟大：皆因士人心中有浩然之气也。

田单镇守即墨，智退燕国，身陷危难，然秉忠诚之气，挥毫之际，扬眉吐气，皆暗合正气之功。吾辈虽处困境，亦自觉心中不乏正气，岂不甚慰？夫正气者，行天地之间，不泥荣辱，不畏生死，方能无憾也。

盖观史而有悟，古之志士仁人，非以汲汲于利禄，而扶持正道，所谓忠臣孝子，皆有一片赤诚，浩然正气存焉。万载之下，其气弥存，人心慕之，不因时而更移。吾今困囚此地，惟怀想古之先贤，心中澄澈，勉励自勉，力爬正道。

读书至是，复得古道正气，重怀旧邦之情，知时势如斯，不可自弃。若无健者之心，事无成也；若无正气相随，步步靡迁。虽则我今乃一囚徒，隐囚其中，形与神俱困，然正气长存，乃为浩然，尽涤垢秽，有此之志，极疆于行。故时困不移，事艰不悔，志士之道，可期可勉矣。

悲兮叹兮，吾怀先贤，与古道相持，心神愉悦，虽困终不懈也。期终有一日，脱此狴犴，扶持正气，以返正道，篱棘见阳，方见浩然之乐。悠悠世事，焉能困我正心哉？故虽狴犴小室，亦难灭吾志向，一扫邪秽，唯存正义正气耳。",易,GPT-4o,古文学,中文,这段文字描述了作者被囚禁在北庭的一间狭小、污秽的土室里，在夏日中感受各种不良气息的侵扰，并感叹自己的弱小和无奈。然而作者自我宽慰，认为自己能够无恙是因为拥有浩然之气，这种气是天地间正气的一部分。随后作者借用历史人物的忠诚和正气，表达自己对浩然正气的信仰，认为这种气是万古不灭的。有了这种正气，生死荣辱就不足为虑。最后，作者感叹身处困境、怀念古代先贤，并表示读书可以让人重新找回古道正气。,640

"壬戌之秋，七月既望，苏子与客泛舟游于赤壁之下。清风徐来，水波不兴。举酒属客，诵明月之诗，歌窈窕之章。少焉，月出于东山之上，徘徊于斗牛之间。白露横江，水光接天。纵一苇之所如，凌万顷之茫然。浩浩乎如冯虚御风，而不知其所止；飘飘乎如遗世独立，羽化而登仙。(冯 通：凭)
于是饮酒乐甚，扣舷而歌之。歌曰：“桂棹兮兰桨，击空明兮溯流光。渺渺兮予怀，望美人兮天一方。”客有吹洞箫者，倚歌而和之。其声呜呜然，如怨如慕，如泣如诉；余音袅袅，不绝如缕。舞幽壑之潜蛟，泣孤舟之嫠妇。
苏子愀然，正襟危坐而问客曰：“何为其然也？”客曰：“‘月明星稀，乌鹊南飞’，此非曹孟德之诗乎？西望夏口，东望武昌，山川相缪，郁乎苍苍，此非孟德之困于周郎者乎？方其破荆州，下江陵，顺流而东也，舳舻千里，旌旗蔽空，酾酒临江，横槊赋诗，固一世之雄也，而今安在哉？况吾与子渔樵于江渚之上，侣鱼虾而友麋鹿，驾一叶之扁舟，举匏樽以相属。寄蜉蝣于天地，渺沧海之一粟。哀吾生之须臾，羡长江之无穷。挟飞仙以遨游，抱明月而长终。知不可乎骤得，托遗响于悲风。”
苏子曰：“客亦知夫水与月乎？逝者如斯，而未尝往也；盈虚者如彼，而卒莫消长也。盖将自其变者而观之，则天地曾不能以一瞬；自其不变者而观之，则物与我皆无尽也，而又何羡乎！且夫天地之间，物各有主，苟非吾之所有，虽一毫而莫取。惟江上之清风，与山间之明月，耳得之而为声，目遇之而成色，取之无禁，用之不竭。是造物者之无尽藏也，而吾与子之所共适。”(共适 一作：共食)
客喜而笑，洗盏更酌。肴核既尽，杯盘狼籍。相与枕藉乎舟中，不知东方之既白","        苏子与友人共游赤壁月夜，时值秋风飒爽，清风徐来。舟中荡漾于碧波之上，四周山水相映，月华如练，洒落江面。二人间情谊深厚，苏子挚友提倡，曰：“明月清风，正逍遥之时，不若饮酒赋诗，以自娱悦。”苏子欣然应允，取来美酒，与友共酌，共话风流。雅兴正浓，苏子举杯言曰：“是夜风清，明月高悬，正其盛也。”随即赋诗一首，吟道：“星垂平野阔，月涌大江流，杳杳寒烟外，萧萧水汽中。”其声悠远悠扬，不觉使人沉醉其中，仿佛随之入梦，形神俱化，何来何去，皆忘于天地间。 
        正酒酣耳热之际，友人忽起，取洞箫一支，吹奏起凄婉之音。其声音飘忽，如泣如诉，似述千古之幽叹。苏子听之，心中感慨万千，叹曰：“闻此箫声，竟使吾念及古今无常。昔日英雄，或建立伟业、或流芳百世，然终皆若过眼云烟，不免为时光所镌灭。今我辈浮游天地之间，岂不亦然乎？” 
        友人闻言，默然叹息，谓苏子曰：“尔之所言甚是。世上功名利禄，争斗成败，皆如梦幻泡影。而今登高望远，清风淡月，江水悠悠，或可托吾等清闲之志，聊以慰怀。”苏子慨然而笑，目所望处，见江水滔滔，月光皎洁，但觉胸襟为之一开，曰：“此清风明月，乃天地所赐之妙物，非人力所得，值千金难购。吾辈当珍惜此自然之美，而不求浮世之荣。” 
        夜渐深沉，清风拂面，洞箫之韵犹在耳际荡漾，二人言笑间，无不感叹人生如寄。终至舟中，苏子与友席地而卧，仰观天上残星，心神俱醉，皆言“忽往来尘世皆如梦寐。”寝息未久，东方既白，晨曦初露，赤壁之游，遂成一段难忘之佳话。",易,GPT-4o,古文学,中文,这段文字描写了苏子（苏东坡）与朋友在秋天的一个夜晚乘舟游览赤壁的情景。他们在清风明月之下饮酒赋诗，欣赏自然美景。中途，朋友吹奏洞箫，其凄美的音律引发了苏子的感慨，他们讨论了历史英雄的兴衰和人生的短暂。最后，苏子表述了对自然美景和人生哲理的理解，强调了清风明月等自然美好事物的无限价值。最终，他们在船中枕藉而眠，直到东方泛白。,662

苏子愀然，正襟危坐而问客曰：“何为其然也？”客曰：“‘月明星稀，乌鹊南飞’，此非曹孟德之诗乎？西望夏口，东望武昌，山川相缪，郁乎苍苍，此非孟德之困于周郎者乎？方其破荆州，下江陵，顺流而东也，舳舻千里，旌旗蔽空，酾酒临江，横槊赋诗，固一世之雄也，而今安在哉？况吾与子渔樵于江渚之上，侣鱼虾而友麋鹿，驾一叶之扁舟，举匏樽以相属。寄蜉蝣于天地，渺沧海之一粟。哀吾生之须臾，羡长江之无穷。挟飞仙以遨游，抱明月而长终。知不可乎骤得，托遗响于悲风。”
苏子曰：“客亦知夫水与月乎？逝者如斯，而未尝往也；盈虚者如彼，而卒莫消长也。盖将自其变者而观之，则天地曾不能以一瞬；自其不变者而观之，则物与我皆无尽也，而又何羡乎！且夫天地之间，物各有主，苟非吾之所有，虽一毫而莫取。惟江上之清风，与山间之明月，耳得之而为声，目遇之而成色，取之无禁，用之不竭。是造物者之无尽藏也，而吾与子之所共适。”(共适 一作：共食)
客喜而笑，洗盏更酌。肴核既尽，杯盘狼籍。相与枕藉乎舟中，不知东方之既白",,,GPT-4o,古文学,中文,这段文字描写了苏子（苏东坡）与朋友在秋天的一个夜晚乘舟游览赤壁的情景。他们在清风明月之下饮酒赋诗，欣赏自然美景。中途，朋友吹奏洞箫，其凄美的音律引发了苏子的感慨，他们讨论了历史英雄的兴衰和人生的短暂。最后，苏子表述了对自然美景和人生哲理的理解，强调了清风明月等自然美好事物的无限价值。最终，他们在船中枕藉而眠，直到东方泛白。,662

呜呼，言有穷而情不可终，汝其知也邪？其不知也邪？呜呼哀哉！尚飨！","嗟乎！兹以清明时节，泪涕滂沱，诵我十二郎也。忆昔年，吾少时丧父，孤弱而依吾兄姊，亦为家属所怜。兄长早故，余少懵懂，家事之艰，皆吾兄嫂付之。况常执手共羡之日，岁余，每每哺食于同榻，景景斯切，至今不忘。十二郎长我岁余，情谊深契，非谓吾兄之婴其其而育之也，吾自与之相待如亲也。

时光荏苒，吾需奔波于人世，以求一仕途，而儿郎亦将尾随余。然不可再同前昔时光，余于外奔波跋涉，儿郎独在家守，心中怅然，寄厚望于哥哥嫂嫂，不敢怠于家事。年少气盛，夙宵心怀鸿图，希乘风破浪，舍小家以顾大业。父兄之责未尽，顾虑万重。时复见儿郎书信寄来，嘱吾保重安康，勿念家事，善自照料。吾心虽安，常依旧念之，焚香于夜，祝愿平安。

及十二郎患疾，虽有以凭之而无尽，药石无效，命数竟绝。吾闻讯夜半，心若雷击。吾未能陪其身侧，未能哭其丧，痛何如甚！每才追思其面容举止，忆昔时欢梁除摧，悲痛若裂。何竟天不假时，吾儿郎竟于病笃巩潭，遗离余也？心伤如潮，泪涌如泉，不任而言。

痛矣痛矣，若今宇宙乍遥阔。总忆儿郎湮灭，思其挚情挚性，不诉平生，不三年，才光逝矣。从今尔时，儿郎之后，自当尽心扶持，教养牵挂。余当以爱子之念，将余两子授之，旦夕不爽与之，非止为之虑何若。料将余事，徜徉耕读于伊、颖之上，守望家庭，严谨不许疏惰，定期复细思虑。

但愿天地不老，亲情为壮，魂兮归来！十二郎，慰吾之忧，解吾之愁，吾未得以尽哀悼之礼，聊书一文以遣哀。",易,GPT-4o,古文学,中文,这段文字描述了一位作者（可能是韩愈）在得知其侄子（十二郎）死亡后，怀着悲痛和愧疚之情写给侄子的祭文。作者回顾了自己和十二郎的共同经历，讲述了自己在少年丧父、依靠兄嫂、兄长早逝、与侄子一同生活的艰难岁月。随后，作者提及自己在外求仕，而与侄子分离的情况，并表达了对未能在侄子病故时尽孝尽责的痛苦与悔恨。最终，作者决定照顾好两人的后代，并计划在伊、颍之上安度余生。全文充满了对逝者的深切哀悼和对未来生活的隐忧。,1277

愿陛下托臣以讨贼兴复之效，不效，则治臣之罪，以告先帝之灵。若无兴德之言，则责攸之、祎、允等之慢，以彰其咎；陛下亦宜自谋，以咨诹善道，察纳雅言，深追先帝遗诏。臣不胜受恩感激。今当远离，临表涕零，不知所言。",,,GPT-4o,古文学,中文,这段文字是诸葛亮在《出师表》中对刘禅所述内容。主要内容包括：先帝刘备创业未完成却中道崩殂，现国家分裂且益州疲弊，处于危急存亡之际。希望刘禅能开明纳谏，公平奖罚，不偏私，亲近贤臣，远离小人。提到侍中的郭攸之、费祎、董允等人是忠良之臣，应当信任、咨询。陈述自己从布衣至今受先帝恩遇，决意报国，现南方已定，准备北伐中原，以兴复汉室。最后，表示如若不能成功复兴汉室，愿承担罪责。,741
"汉末建安中，庐江府小吏焦仲卿妻刘氏，为仲卿母所遣，自誓不嫁。其家逼之，乃投水而死。仲卿闻之，亦自缢于庭树。时人伤之，为诗云尔。
孔雀东南飞，五里一徘徊。
“十三能织素，十四学裁衣。十五弹箜篌，十六诵诗书。十七为君妇，心中常苦悲。君既为府吏，守节情不移。贱妾留空房，相见常日稀。鸡鸣入机织，夜夜不得息。三日断五匹，大人故嫌迟。非为织作迟，君家妇难为！妾不堪驱使，徒留无所施。便可白公姥，及时相遣归。”
府吏得闻之，堂上启阿母：“儿已薄禄相，幸复得此妇。结发同枕席，黄泉共为友。共事二三年，始尔未为久。女行无偏斜，何意致不厚。”
阿母谓府吏：“何乃太区区！此妇无礼节，举动自专由。吾意久怀忿，汝岂得自由！东家有贤女，自名秦罗敷。可怜体无比，阿母为汝求。便可速遣之，遣去慎莫留！”
府吏长跪告：“伏惟启阿母。今若遣此妇，终老不复取！”
阿母得闻之，槌床便大怒：“小子无所畏，何敢助妇语！吾已失恩义，会不相从许！”
府吏默无声，再拜还入户。举言谓新妇，哽咽不能语：“我自不驱卿，逼迫有阿母。卿但暂还家，吾今且报府。不久当归还，还必相迎取。以此下心意，慎勿违吾语。”
新妇谓府吏：“勿复重纷纭。往昔初阳岁，谢家来贵门。奉事循公姥，进止敢自专？昼夜勤作息，伶俜萦苦辛。谓言无罪过，供养卒大恩；仍更被驱遣，何言复来还！妾有绣腰襦，葳蕤自生光；红罗复斗帐，四角垂香囊；箱帘六七十，绿碧青丝绳，物物各自异，种种在其中。人贱物亦鄙，不足迎后人，留待作遗施，于今无会因。时时为安慰，久久莫相忘！”
鸡鸣外欲曙，新妇起严妆。著我绣夹裙，事事四五通。足下蹑丝履，头上玳瑁光。腰若流纨素，耳著明月珰。指如削葱根，口如含朱丹。纤纤作细步，精妙世无双。
上堂拜阿母，阿母怒不止。“昔作女儿时，生小出野里。本自无教训，兼愧贵家子。受母钱帛多，不堪母驱使。今日还家去，念母劳家里。”却与小姑别，泪落连珠子。“新妇初来时，小姑始扶床；今日被驱遣，小姑如我长。勤心养公姥，好自相扶将。初七及下九，嬉戏莫相忘。”出门登车去，涕落百余行。
府吏马在前，新妇车在后。隐隐何甸甸，俱会大道口。下马入车中，低头共耳语：“誓不相隔卿，且暂还家去。吾今且赴府，不久当还归。誓天不相负！”
新妇谓府吏：“感君区区怀！君既若见录，不久望君来。君当作磐石，妾当作蒲苇。蒲苇纫如丝，磐石无转移。我有亲父兄，性行暴如雷，恐不任我意，逆以煎我怀。”举手长劳劳，二情同依依 。
入门上家堂，进退无颜仪。阿母大拊掌，不图子自归：“十三教汝织，十四能裁衣，十五弹箜篌，十六知礼仪，十七遣汝嫁，谓言无誓违。汝今何罪过，不迎而自归？”兰芝惭阿母：“儿实无罪过。”阿母大悲摧。
还家十余日，县令遣媒来。云有第三郎，窈窕世无双。年始十八九，便言多令才。
阿母谓阿女：“汝可去应之。”
阿女含泪答：“兰芝初还时，府吏见丁宁，结誓不别离。今日违情义，恐此事非奇。自可断来信，徐徐更谓之。”
阿母白媒人：“贫贱有此女，始适还家门。不堪吏人妇，岂合令郎君？幸可广问讯，不得便相许。”
媒人去数日，寻遣丞请还，说有兰家女，承籍有宦官。云有第五郎，娇逸未有婚。遣丞为媒人，主簿通语言。直说太守家，有此令郎君，既欲结大义，故遣来贵门。
阿母谢媒人：“女子先有誓，老姥岂敢言！”
阿兄得闻之，怅然心中烦。举言谓阿妹：“作计何不量！先嫁得府吏，后嫁得郎君。否泰如天地，足以荣汝身。不嫁义郎体，其往欲何云？”
兰芝仰头答：“理实如兄言。谢家事夫婿，中道还兄门。处分适兄意，那得自任专！虽与府吏要，渠会永无缘。登即相许和，便可作婚姻。”媒人下床去。诺诺复尔尔。还部白府君：“下官奉使命，言谈大有缘。”府君得闻之，心中大欢喜。视历复开书，便利此月内，六合正相应。良吉三十日，今已二十七，卿可去成婚。交语速装束，络绎如浮云。青雀白鹄舫，四角龙子幡。婀娜随风转，金车玉作轮。踯躅青骢马，流苏金镂鞍。赍钱三百万，皆用青丝穿。杂彩三百匹，交广市鲑珍。从人四五百，郁郁登郡门。
阿母谓阿女：“适得府君书，明日来迎汝。何不作衣裳？莫令事不举！”
阿女默无声，手巾掩口啼，泪落便如泻。移我琉璃榻，出置前窗下。左手持刀尺，右手执绫罗。朝成绣夹裙，晚成单罗衫。晻晻日欲暝，愁思出门啼。
府吏闻此变，因求假暂归。未至二三里，摧藏马悲哀。新妇识马声，蹑履相逢迎。怅然遥相望，知是故人来。举手拍马鞍，嗟叹使心伤：“自君别我后，人事不可量。果不如先愿，又非君所详。我有亲父母，逼迫兼弟兄。以我应他人，君还何所望！”
府吏谓新妇：“贺卿得高迁！磐石方且厚，可以卒千年；蒲苇一时纫，便作旦夕间。卿当日胜贵，吾独向黄泉！”
新妇谓府吏：“何意出此言！同是被逼迫，君尔妾亦然。黄泉下相见，勿违今日言！”执手分道去，各各还家门。生人作死别，恨恨那可论？念与世间辞，千万不复全！
府吏还家去，上堂拜阿母：“今日大风寒，寒风摧树木，严霜结庭兰。儿今日冥冥，令母在后单。故作不良计，勿复怨鬼神！命如南山石，四体康且直！”
阿母得闻之，零泪应声落：“汝是大家子，仕宦于台阁。慎勿为妇死，贵贱情何薄！东家有贤女，窈窕艳城郭，阿母为汝求，便复在旦夕。”
府吏再拜还，长叹空房中，作计乃尔立。转头向户里，渐见愁煎迫。
其日牛马嘶，新妇入青庐。奄奄黄昏后，寂寂人定初。“我命绝今日，魂去尸长留！”揽裙脱丝履，举身赴清池。
府吏闻此事，心知长别离。徘徊庭树下，自挂东南枝。
两家求合葬，合葬华山傍。东西植松柏，左右种梧桐。枝枝相覆盖，叶叶相交通。中有双飞鸟，自名为鸳鸯。仰头相向鸣，夜夜达五更。行人驻足听，寡妇起彷徨。多谢后世人，戒之慎勿忘。",东汉末年，庐江府有一小吏，名焦仲卿，忠厚善良，勤奋谋事，深得上司所赏识。家中有妻，姓刘名兰芝，生得容姿美丽，贤慧聪敏。夫妻二人琴瑟和鸣，情谊深厚，宛如天地合璧，人皆称羡。有一日，仲卿之母，素来苛刻严厉，见兰芝举止稍有不合，心中甚是不悦，遂意欲遣其离家。兰芝温良恭俭，不敢当面忤逆婆母，只得在仲卿面前悲诉道：“夫君，我虽不才，然侍奉君母，尽心尽力，自问无愧。今君母欲遣我归，妾身心痛如割。”仲卿听闻，心中亦甚忧苦，然为孝道所迫，不敢违逆母命，唯有劝慰兰芝道：“吾妻请勿忧，吾当尽一切努力令母心转，盼君暂且归家，待我说服母亲，必迎君归。”兰芝掩泣应诺，心中却是万分惆怅。焦母态度坚决，仲卿用尽苦言，亦无法挽回，遂不得已，只得送兰芝归其娘家。兰芝回到娘家，父母见其容色凄凉，知其遭遇之事，甚为心痛。然来年，刘家忽有一贵公子求娶兰芝，家中长辈见其门第显赫，心生许诺之意，纷纷劝说兰芝再嫁。兰芝闻之，泪如雨下，答道：“妾与焦郎虽缘尽犹在，心属终生，方敢毁诺？即使再生，也只愿与郎同赴黄泉，又岂再嫁他人？”父母见其意坚，不忍强逼，只能任其意愿。数日后，有媒妁至门，兰芝避而不见，心中悲痛，遂至后园深井，终不忍世俗逼迫，绝意投水而亡。焦仲卿得知兰芝自尽，心如刀绞，怅然若失，不忍独活于世。翌日，于庭树下悬梁自缢，殒命其间。亲友闻之，无不悲恸，感慨其情。有识之士为之立碑铭曰：“佳人有泪，鸳鸯无梦。焦刘二士，天上双星。”百年之后，兰芝与仲卿合葬于庐江山间，后人祭拜不断，称颂其爱情故事，千秋不朽。,易,GPT-4o,古文学,中文,这段文字出自《孔雀东南飞》，讲述了东汉末年庐江府小吏焦仲卿和妻子刘兰芝之间的爱情悲剧。因仲卿母亲不满兰芝的行为，坚持要遣走兰芝，导致夫妻二人被迫分离。兰芝被迫返回娘家后，家人强逼她改嫁他人，但兰芝与仲卿相爱至深，誓不再嫁，最终投水自尽。仲卿得知兰芝的死讯，悲痛欲绝，自缢于庭树。两人死后合葬，象征着他们深厚的爱情故事。,2256

天长地久有时尽，此恨绵绵无绝期。","在唐朝盛世之时，玄宗皇帝与杨贵妃之爱情，令人于史书中唏嘘不已。玄宗一朝，天下富庶，然君王心有所属，更重于宫闱之欢愉。杨贵妃出身名门，姿态倾城，一见玄宗，便成终身深情之缘。

奇姿异态，艳压群芳，玄宗见之，心旌摇曳。皇宫之内，美酒佳肴盈室，佳人相伴，帝王欢愉莫不如此。杨贵妃以其柔情似水，深得玄宗宠爱，伴随左右，谓之“君王常伴夕阳下”。

岁月静好，昼夜相携，二人将宫廷之门主掌为处，独享红尘漫漫。庭前花下，垂柳拂地，月夜星稀，乃君王与美妇谈情之时。而这短暂之欢愉，竟如朝露一晤，终不长久。

忽逢天翻地覆，安禄山叛乱，一举摧毁昔日之安宁。宫廷内外，哀鸿遍野，兵戈之声震动九重。玄宗无奈，撤退蜀地。然贵妃因其得宠，激起诸将不满，逼迫君王以死息纷争。

青山如旧，妾身已去。杨贵妃以终命报君恩，玄宗痛不欲生，世间竟无相依之人。生离死别，成千古恨，原本浓情转为幽愁，孤寂深深。惟余玄宗每日对月长叹，无奈思念逝去之情。

世间情爱，历经阴阳两隔，无奈之情犹存吾心。玄宗抱病，不见佳人容颜，心中郁结不解。惟愿与之再会，不枉此生眷恋。而方士蓝缕，玄宗求之，泣诉心愿。方士披云撩雾，求之仙山，终与佳人邂逅。

茫茫青冢何处，漫漫仙山相会。凝情瞬间，永别化为永恒。举目相视，两眼泪水涌流，千言万语皆诉衷肠。隔世情仇，终得解落尘埃。

玄宗虽与杨贵妃阴阳两隔，但此世之爱，竟永不消逝。两心相念，君心似江飘泗，妾意如玉恒沙。虽千岁如一昼，却难懈真情。人间多少聚散离合，无非真情一脉。贵妃幽魂，玄宗心里，已然永恒，不曾须臾相忘。

此篇叙唐玄宗与杨贵妃之故事，意在描绘情感之重，哀怨之深。虽终将天人永隔，但爱之深情，常驻心间，生死不负，以念成疾。此长恨歌传世千载，未曾销匿，只因其情真意切，感人至深，熠熠生辉。",易,GPT-4o,古文学,中文,这段文字出自唐代诗人白居易的《长恨歌》，描述了唐玄宗与杨贵妃之间的爱情故事。开头讲述了唐玄宗对杨贵妃的宠爱，在她入宫后，两人度过了一段甜蜜时光。接着，安史之乱爆发，杨贵妃被逼自尽，玄宗悲痛不已。之后，两人阴阳相隔，玄宗思念成疾，最终通过方士在仙山中与杨贵妃再会，表达了他们永不消逝的爱情和无尽的哀恨。,960

"洪武八年十有一月壬子，皇上以太子暨诸王久处宫掖，无以发抒精神，命西幸中都，沿道校猎，以讲武事。濂时奉诏扈从。十有二月戊午，次滁州驿。濂进启曰：“臣闻琅琊山在州西南十里，晋元帝潜龙之地。帝尝封琅琊王，山因以名。颇闻秀丽伟拔，为淮东奇观，愿一游焉而未能也。敢请。”皇太子欢然可之。即约四长史同行：秦王府则林伯恭，晋王府则朱伯贤，楚王府则朱伯清，靖王府则赵伯友。遂自驿西南出。
过平皋约三里所，望丰山盘亘雄伟出琅琊诸峰上。唐梁载言《十道志》又云：“丰亭山。山上有汉高祖祠，又有饮马池。世俗妄传汉高祖曾饮马于此。”国朝以山麓为畜养之场，别凿池饮马，仍揭以旧名。居人指云：山下有幽谷，地形低洼，四面皆山，其中有紫微泉，宋欧阳公修所发。泉上十余步即丰乐亭，直丰乐亭之东数百步，至山椒，即醒心亭。由亭曲转而西入天宁寺。今皆废，惟凉烟白草而已。濂闻其语，为怅然者久之。
东南有柏子潭。潭在深谷底，延袤亩余，色正深黑。即欧阳公赛龙处，上有五龙祠。皇上初龙飞，屯兵于滁，会旱暵，亲挟雕弓，注矢于潭者三，约三日雨，如期果大雨。及御宝历，为作栏楯护潭，且新其庙。庙侧有时若亭。濂坐亭上，问潭侧双燕洞及其南白鸽洞，以肆穷览，人无知者，乃止。复西行约三里许，有泉泻出于两山之间，分流而下，曰让泉，潺潺清澈，可鉴毛发。傍岸有亭曰“渐入佳境”，今已废，惟四大字勒崖石间。淳熙中郡守张商卿等题名尚存。

浔阳江头夜送客，枫叶荻花秋瑟瑟。
主人下马客在船，举酒欲饮无管弦。
醉不成欢惨将别，别时茫茫江浸月。
忽闻水上琵琶声，主人忘归客不发。
寻声暗问弹者谁，琵琶声停欲语迟。
移船相近邀相见，添酒回灯重开宴。
千呼万唤始出来，犹抱琵琶半遮面。
转轴拨弦三两声，未成曲调先有情。
弦弦掩抑声声思，似诉平生不得志。
低眉信手续续弹，说尽心中无限事。
轻拢慢捻抹复挑，初为《霓裳》后《六幺》。
大弦嘈嘈如急雨，小弦切切如私语。
嘈嘈切切错杂弹，大珠小珠落玉盘。
间关莺语花底滑，幽咽泉流冰下难。
冰泉冷涩弦凝绝，凝绝不通声暂歇。
别有幽愁暗恨生，此时无声胜有声。
银瓶乍破水浆迸，铁骑突出刀枪鸣。
曲终收拨当心画，四弦一声如裂帛。
东船西舫悄无言，唯见江心秋月白。
沉吟放拨插弦中，整顿衣裳起敛容。
自言本是京城女，家在虾蟆陵下住。
十三学得琵琶成，名属教坊第一部。
曲罢曾教善才服，妆成每被秋娘妒。
五陵年少争缠头，一曲红绡不知数。
钿头银篦击节碎，血色罗裙翻酒污
今年欢笑复明年，秋月春风等闲度。
弟走从军阿姨死，暮去朝来颜色故。
门前冷落鞍马稀，老大嫁作商人妇。
商人重利轻别离，前月浮梁买茶去。
去来江口守空船，绕船月明江水寒。
夜深忽梦少年事，梦啼妆泪红阑干。
我闻琵琶已叹息，又闻此语重唧唧。
同是天涯沦落人，相逢何必曾相识！
我从去年辞帝京，谪居卧病浔阳城。
浔阳地僻无音乐，终岁不闻丝竹声。
住近湓江地低湿，黄芦苦竹绕宅生。
其间旦暮闻何物？杜鹃啼血猿哀鸣。
春江花朝秋月夜，往往取酒还独倾。
岂无山歌与村笛，呕哑嘲哳难为听。
今夜闻君琵琶语，如听仙乐耳暂明。
莫辞更坐弹一曲，为君翻作《琵琶行》。
感我此言良久立，却坐促弦弦转急。
凄凄不似向前声，满座重闻皆掩泣。
座中泣下谁最多？江州司马青衫湿。","元和十年秋，秋风萧瑟，白居易独坐湓浦口，目送友人远去，心有戚戚然。忽闻琵琶声，幽幽而来，似泣似诉，怨不绝于耳。白居易循声而望，见一女子，素衣淡妆，手持琵琶，神情忧郁。白居易心中生疑，上前询问其来历。

女子轻启朱唇，自称来自长安，曾在京师乐籍为妓，精通音律，尤擅琵琶。一曲《红颜知己》，京师无数士人皆为倾倒。然年华易逝，花容渐老，色衰爱驰，终为商人所娶为妻。商人数日即外出经商，留下她独守空房，寂寞凄凉，苦不堪言。今随夫商旅至此，不期与白居易相遇。

白居易闻言，心有戚戚，叹道：“吾亦有思乡念友之苦，虽官职微贬，犹感人生蹉跎。闻君琵琶声，犹如闻旧友之音，心中感慨万千。愿闻君奏一曲，以慰我心。”

女子点头，将琵琶横于膝间，拨弦而奏。初闻似流水潺潺，后若大江东去，忽而铮铮有声，如同金戈铁马；忽而盈耳无声，似风过松声。曲终泪满襟，白居易忍不住泪下，感叹道：“妙音如斯，何其悲凉！”

白居易请女子稍坐，为其作诗一首，以表心中感怀。诗曰：

"元和十年，予左迁九江郡司马。明年秋，送客湓浦口，闻舟中夜弹琵琶者，听其音，铮铮然有京都声。问其人，本长安倡女，尝学琵琶于穆、曹二善才，年长色衰，委身为贾人妇。遂命酒，使快弹数曲。曲罢悯然，自叙少小时欢乐事，今漂沦憔悴，转徙于江湖间。予出官二年，恬然自安，感斯人言，是夕始觉有迁谪意。因为长句，歌以赠之，凡六百一十六言，命曰《琵琶行》。
浔阳江头夜送客，枫叶荻花秋瑟瑟。
主人下马客在船，举酒欲饮无管弦。
醉不成欢惨将别，别时茫茫江浸月。
忽闻水上琵琶声，主人忘归客不发。
寻声暗问弹者谁，琵琶声停欲语迟。
移船相近邀相见，添酒回灯重开宴。
千呼万唤始出来，犹抱琵琶半遮面。
转轴拨弦三两声，未成曲调先有情。
弦弦掩抑声声思，似诉平生不得志。
低眉信手续续弹，说尽心中无限事。
轻拢慢捻抹复挑，初为《霓裳》后《六幺》。
大弦嘈嘈如急雨，小弦切切如私语。
嘈嘈切切错杂弹，大珠小珠落玉盘。
间关莺语花底滑，幽咽泉流冰下难。
冰泉冷涩弦凝绝，凝绝不通声暂歇。
别有幽愁暗恨生，此时无声胜有声。
银瓶乍破水浆迸，铁骑突出刀枪鸣。
曲终收拨当心画，四弦一声如裂帛。
东船西舫悄无言，唯见江心秋月白。
沉吟放拨插弦中，整顿衣裳起敛容。
自言本是京城女，家在虾蟆陵下住。
十三学得琵琶成，名属教坊第一部。
曲罢曾教善才服，妆成每被秋娘妒。
五陵年少争缠头，一曲红绡不知数。

桐城姚鼐记。","乾隆三十九年十二月，余不惮风寒，欲纵观江山之美景，遂起行于京师。初发于晨，奔涉齐河、长清，途次多阻，犹觉艰险。及至泰山西北，入谷中，幽邃奇绝，地势险峻，山川屏息。不日抵泰安，见知府朱孝纯之子朱颍，颍者，知才之士，情宜友好，同登泰山，以资良友共游之法。是日，由东南麓始登，甫入山门，天地浑然；山中多石少土，苍黑巍峨，奇峰突兀。松树遍布，寒风卷雪，朔气逼人，岚光照梦。行至山腰，已疲，然山之壮，气之豪，激励余等接续攀登。

既而半道，霜雪益重，步履维艰。时日未曦，抵泰山之巅。观日亭立于巅上，四顾茫茫，无人寂寥。时而东方曙光初现，晨曦吐丹，辉光万丈，直达九天之外，山河变色，仰见大地之波澜，与天接壤。鹄立其上，神思飞扬。亭西有岱祠，供奉岱宗神祗，辉煌巍峨。祠旁建有碧霞元君祠，香火鼎盛，殿宇高悬。

山中行者，时有石刻，碑铭遍布，古今名家刻姓。或字迹残蚀，或碑影孤伶，每观一字，即思一人，其志可慰，抚碑泣下。终日不知疲，山路漫漫，虽困而乐。俟下山，始归京师，心慰悠然，余与朱公子论道，于山川天地间得乐趣无穷。

泰山之景，非独其险，且其巍巍乎高，缙绅之志，皆以探其主意。山体苍黑，松林啸雪，霜霏万里，静穆高洁。每遇风起，天地同音，盖如神之诉呼，使人忘形。余记山中有名之刻，以示后人，泰山实在者，宜尽登览，以识天地奇妙。",易,GPT-4o,古文学,中文,这段文字描述了作者姚鼐在乾隆三十九年十二月冬季，从京师出发，经齐河、长清，穿越泰山西北谷到达泰安，并与知府朱孝纯之子朱颍一同从泰山东南麓攀登泰山的经历。具体记录了登山过程中的地理景观、气象条件以及沿途的艰辛。作者见到的景象包括泰山的多石少土、苍黑色山体、密布的松树以及覆盖积雪的景象，在山顶的日观亭等待日出，描述了日出时的美景及其壮丽，也提及了亭西的岱祠和碧霞元君祠等建筑，并且提到古今石刻的状况。最后，作者对泰山的自然环境做了详细记录。,538

What’s the matter now?

No, by the rood, not so.
You are the Queen, your husband’s brother’s wife,
And, would it were not so. You are my mother.

Come, come, and sit you down, you shall not budge.
You go not till I set you up a glass
Where you may see the inmost part of you.

O me, what hast thou done?
HAMLET.
Nay, I know not. Is it the King?

O what a rash and bloody deed is this!
HAMLET.
A bloody deed. Almost as bad, good mother,
As kill a king and marry with his brother.
QUEEN.
As kill a king?
HAMLET.
Ay, lady, ’twas my word.—
[To Polonius.] Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune,
Thou find’st to be too busy is some danger.—
Leave wringing of your hands. Peace, sit you down,
And let me wring your heart, for so I shall,
If it be made of penetrable stuff;
If damned custom have not braz’d it so,
That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
QUEEN.
What have I done, that thou dar’st wag thy tongue
In noise so rude against me?
HAMLET.
Such an act
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
And sets a blister there. Makes marriage vows
As false as dicers’ oaths. O such a deed
As from the body of contraction plucks
The very soul, and sweet religion makes
A rhapsody of words. Heaven’s face doth glow,
Yea this solidity and compound mass,
With tristful visage, as against the doom,
Is thought-sick at the act.
QUEEN.
Ay me, what act,
That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
HAMLET.
Look here upon this picture, and on this,
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
See what a grace was seated on this brow,
Hyperion’s curls, the front of Jove himself,
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command,
A station like the herald Mercury
New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
A combination and a form indeed,
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
To give the world assurance of a man.
This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
Here is your husband, like a mildew’d ear
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
You cannot call it love; for at your age
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it’s humble,
And waits upon the judgement: and what judgement
Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
Is apoplex’d, for madness would not err
Nor sense to ecstacy was ne’er so thrall’d
But it reserv’d some quantity of choice
To serve in such a difference. What devil was’t
That thus hath cozen’d you at hoodman-blind?
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
Or but a sickly part of one true sense
Could not so mope. O shame! where is thy blush?
Rebellious hell,
If thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones,
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
And reason panders will.
QUEEN.
O Hamlet, speak no more.
Thou turn’st mine eyes into my very soul,
And there I see such black and grained spots
As will not leave their tinct.
HAMLET.
Nay, but to live
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
Stew’d in corruption, honeying and making love
Over the nasty sty.
QUEEN.
O speak to me no more;
These words like daggers enter in mine ears;
No more, sweet Hamlet.
HAMLET.
A murderer and a villain;
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
Of your precedent lord. A vice of kings,
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
And put it in his pocket!
QUEEN.
No more.
HAMLET.
A king of shreds and patches!—
Enter Ghost.
Save me and hover o’er me with your wings,
You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
QUEEN.
Alas, he’s mad.
HAMLET.
Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
That, laps’d in time and passion, lets go by
The important acting of your dread command?
O say!
GHOST.
Do not forget. This visitation
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
O step between her and her fighting soul.
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
Speak to her, Hamlet.
HAMLET.
How is it with you, lady?
QUEEN.
Alas, how is’t with you,
That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep,
And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
HAMLET.
On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares,
His form and cause conjoin’d, preaching to stones,
Would make them capable.—Do not look upon me,
Lest with this piteous action you convert
My stern effects. Then what I have to do
Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
QUEEN.
To whom do you speak this?
HAMLET.
Do you see nothing there?
QUEEN.
Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
HAMLET.
Nor did you nothing hear?
QUEEN.
No, nothing but ourselves.
HAMLET.
Why, look you there! look how it steals away!
My father, in his habit as he liv’d!
Look where he goes even now out at the portal.","Hwæt, þaet wæs on thære tide, þæt Hamlet se ridda his modor, þaere cwen Gertrude, gefreoðeode be hire weddunge to his fæðera broðor Claudius, neah þære deað of his fæder.

The confrontation escalates when Hamlet accidentally kills Polonius, who is hiding behind a curtain, thinking he was Claudius. Hamlet harshly criticizes his mother's actions, claiming they are immoral and dishonorable. The tension between mother and son is palpable as Hamlet expresses his deep disappointment and anger. The appearance of the Ghost of King Hamlet adds to the drama, as he reminds Hamlet of his mission and urges him to speak gently to Gertrude. The Queen, unable to see the Ghost, believes Hamlet is mad and listens in horror as Hamlet describes the Ghost's presence.",1092

O step between her and her fighting soul.
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
Speak to her, Hamlet.
HAMLET.
How is it with you, lady?
QUEEN.
Alas, how is’t with you,
That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep,
And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
HAMLET.
On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares,
His form and cause conjoin’d, preaching to stones,
Would make them capable.—Do not look upon me,
Lest with this piteous action you convert
My stern effects. Then what I have to do
Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
QUEEN.
To whom do you speak this?
HAMLET.
Do you see nothing there?
QUEEN.
Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
HAMLET.
Nor did you nothing hear?
QUEEN.
No, nothing but ourselves.

"HAMLET.
Now, mother, what’s the matter?
QUEEN.
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
HAMLET.
Mother, you have my father much offended.
QUEEN.
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
HAMLET.
Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
QUEEN.
Why, how now, Hamlet?
HAMLET.
What’s the matter now?
QUEEN.
Have you forgot me?
HAMLET.
No, by the rood, not so.
You are the Queen, your husband’s brother’s wife,
And, would it were not so. You are my mother.
QUEEN.
Nay, then I’ll set those to you that can speak.
HAMLET.
Come, come, and sit you down, you shall not budge.
You go not till I set you up a glass
Where you may see the inmost part of you.
QUEEN.
What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me?
Help, help, ho!
POLONIUS.
[Behind.] What, ho! help, help, help!
HAMLET.
How now? A rat? [Draws.]
Dead for a ducat, dead!
[Makes a pass through the arras.]
POLONIUS.
[Behind.] O, I am slain!
[Falls and dies.]
QUEEN.
O me, what hast thou done?
HAMLET.
Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
[Draws forth Polonius.]
QUEEN.
O what a rash and bloody deed is this!
HAMLET.
A bloody deed. Almost as bad, good mother,
As kill a king and marry with his brother.
QUEEN.
As kill a king?
HAMLET.
Ay, lady, ’twas my word.—
[To Polonius.] Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune,
Thou find’st to be too busy is some danger.—
Leave wringing of your hands. Peace, sit you down,
And let me wring your heart, for so I shall,
If it be made of penetrable stuff;
If damned custom have not braz’d it so,
That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
QUEEN.
What have I done, that thou dar’st wag thy tongue
In noise so rude against me?
HAMLET.
Such an act
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
And sets a blister there. Makes marriage vows
As false as dicers’ oaths. O such a deed
As from the body of contraction plucks
The very soul, and sweet religion makes
A rhapsody of words. Heaven’s face doth glow,
Yea this solidity and compound mass,
With tristful visage, as against the doom,
Is thought-sick at the act.
QUEEN.
Ay me, what act,
That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
HAMLET.
Look here upon this picture, and on this,
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
See what a grace was seated on this brow,
Hyperion’s curls, the front of Jove himself,
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command,
A station like the herald Mercury
New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
A combination and a form indeed,
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
To give the world assurance of a man.
This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
Here is your husband, like a mildew’d ear
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
You cannot call it love; for at your age
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it’s humble,
And waits upon the judgement: and what judgement
Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
Is apoplex’d, for madness would not err
Nor sense to ecstacy was ne’er so thrall’d
But it reserv’d some quantity of choice
To serve in such a difference. What devil was’t
That thus hath cozen’d you at hoodman-blind?
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
Or but a sickly part of one true sense
Could not so mope. O shame! where is thy blush?
Rebellious hell,
If thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones,
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
And reason panders will.
QUEEN.
O Hamlet, speak no more.
Thou turn’st mine eyes into my very soul,
And there I see such black and grained spots
As will not leave their tinct.
HAMLET.
Nay, but to live
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
Stew’d in corruption, honeying and making love
Over the nasty sty.
QUEEN.
O speak to me no more;
These words like daggers enter in mine ears;
No more, sweet Hamlet.
HAMLET.
A murderer and a villain;
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
Of your precedent lord. A vice of kings,
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
And put it in his pocket!
QUEEN.
No more.
HAMLET.
A king of shreds and patches!—
Enter Ghost.
Save me and hover o’er me with your wings,
You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
QUEEN.
Alas, he’s mad.
HAMLET.
Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
That, laps’d in time and passion, lets go by
The important acting of your dread command?
O say!
GHOST.
Do not forget. This visitation
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
O step between her and her fighting soul.
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
Speak to her, Hamlet.

"MALCOLM.
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there
Weep our sad bosoms empty.
MACDUFF.
Let us rather
Hold fast the mortal sword, and, like good men,
Bestride our down-fall’n birthdom. Each new morn
New widows howl, new orphans cry; new sorrows
Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds
As if it felt with Scotland, and yell’d out
Like syllable of dolour.
MALCOLM.
What I believe, I’ll wail;
What know, believe; and what I can redress,
As I shall find the time to friend, I will.
What you have spoke, it may be so, perchance.
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
Was once thought honest: you have loved him well;
He hath not touch’d you yet. I am young; but something
You may deserve of him through me; and wisdom
To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb
To appease an angry god.
MACDUFF.
I am not treacherous.
MALCOLM.
But Macbeth is.
A good and virtuous nature may recoil
In an imperial charge. But I shall crave your pardon.
That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell:
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,
Yet grace must still look so.
MACDUFF.
I have lost my hopes.
MALCOLM.
Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
Why in that rawness left you wife and child,
Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,
Without leave-taking?—I pray you,
Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,
But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,
Whatever I shall think.
MACDUFF.
Bleed, bleed, poor country!
Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,
For goodness dare not check thee! wear thou thy wrongs;
The title is affeer’d.—Fare thee well, lord:
I would not be the villain that thou think’st
For the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp
And the rich East to boot.
MALCOLM.
Be not offended:
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash
Is added to her wounds. I think, withal,
There would be hands uplifted in my right;
And here, from gracious England, have I offer
Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,
When I shall tread upon the tyrant’s head,
Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
Shall have more vices than it had before,
More suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,
By him that shall succeed.
MACDUFF.
What should he be?
MALCOLM.
It is myself I mean; in whom I know
All the particulars of vice so grafted
That, when they shall be open’d, black Macbeth
Will seem as pure as snow; and the poor state
Esteem him as a lamb, being compar’d
With my confineless harms.
MACDUFF.
Not in the legions
Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn’d
In evils to top Macbeth.
MALCOLM.
I grant him bloody,
Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
That has a name: but there’s no bottom, none,
In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,
Your matrons, and your maids, could not fill up
The cistern of my lust; and my desire
All continent impediments would o’erbear,
That did oppose my will: better Macbeth
Than such an one to reign.
MACDUFF.
Boundless intemperance
In nature is a tyranny; it hath been
Th’ untimely emptying of the happy throne,
And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
To take upon you what is yours: you may
Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,
And yet seem cold—the time you may so hoodwink.
We have willing dames enough; there cannot be
That vulture in you, to devour so many
As will to greatness dedicate themselves,
Finding it so inclin’d.
MALCOLM.
With this there grows
In my most ill-compos’d affection such
A staunchless avarice, that, were I king,
I should cut off the nobles for their lands;
Desire his jewels, and this other’s house:
And my more-having would be as a sauce
To make me hunger more; that I should forge
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
Destroying them for wealth.
MACDUFF.
This avarice
Sticks deeper; grows with more pernicious root
Than summer-seeming lust; and it hath been
The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;
Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will,
Of your mere own. All these are portable,
With other graces weigh’d.
MALCOLM.
But I have none: the king-becoming graces,
As justice, verity, temp’rance, stableness,
Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
I have no relish of them; but abound
In the division of each several crime,
Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
Uproar the universal peace, confound
All unity on earth.
MACDUFF.
O Scotland, Scotland!
MALCOLM.
If such a one be fit to govern, speak:
I am as I have spoken.
MACDUFF.
Fit to govern?
No, not to live.—O nation miserable,
With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter’d,
When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
Since that the truest issue of thy throne
By his own interdiction stands accus’d,
And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father
Was a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee,
Oft’ner upon her knees than on her feet,
Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!
These evils thou repeat’st upon thyself
Have banish’d me from Scotland.—O my breast,
Thy hope ends here!
MALCOLM.
Macduff, this noble passion,
Child of integrity, hath from my soul
Wiped the black scruples, reconcil’d my thoughts
To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth
By many of these trains hath sought to win me
Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
From over-credulous haste: but God above
Deal between thee and me! for even now
I put myself to thy direction, and
Unspeak mine own detraction; here abjure
The taints and blames I laid upon myself,
For strangers to my nature. I am yet
Unknown to woman; never was forsworn;
Scarcely have coveted what was mine own;
At no time broke my faith; would not betray
The devil to his fellow; and delight
No less in truth than life: my first false speaking
Was this upon myself. What I am truly,
Is thine and my poor country’s to command:
Whither, indeed, before thy here-approach,
Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,
Already at a point, was setting forth.
Now we’ll together, and the chance of goodness
Be like our warranted quarrel. Why are you silent?
MACDUFF.
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once

In the division of each several crime,
Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
Uproar the universal peace, confound
All unity on earth.
MACDUFF.
O Scotland, Scotland!
MALCOLM.
If such a one be fit to govern, speak:
I am as I have spoken.
MACDUFF.
Fit to govern?
No, not to live.—O nation miserable,
With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter’d,
When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
Since that the truest issue of thy throne
By his own interdiction stands accus’d,
And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father
Was a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee,
Oft’ner upon her knees than on her feet,
Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!
These evils thou repeat’st upon thyself
Have banish’d me from Scotland.—O my breast,
Thy hope ends here!
MALCOLM.
Macduff, this noble passion,
Child of integrity, hath from my soul
Wiped the black scruples, reconcil’d my thoughts
To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth
By many of these trains hath sought to win me
Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
From over-credulous haste: but God above
Deal between thee and me! for even now
I put myself to thy direction, and
Unspeak mine own detraction; here abjure
The taints and blames I laid upon myself,
For strangers to my nature. I am yet
Unknown to woman; never was forsworn;
Scarcely have coveted what was mine own;
At no time broke my faith; would not betray
The devil to his fellow; and delight
No less in truth than life: my first false speaking
Was this upon myself. What I am truly,
Is thine and my poor country’s to command:
Whither, indeed, before thy here-approach,
Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,
Already at a point, was setting forth.
Now we’ll together, and the chance of goodness
Be like our warranted quarrel. Why are you silent?
MACDUFF.
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
’Tis hard to reconcile.
",,,GPT-4o,古文学,英文,"In this passage from Shakespeare's 'Macbeth,' Malcolm and Macduff discuss the plight of Scotland under Macbeth's tyrannical rule. Malcolm initially tests Macduff's loyalty by pretending to be more corrupt and unfit to rule than Macbeth. Macduff passionately rejects the idea of Malcolm being worse than Macbeth, prompting Malcolm to reveal that he was lying to test Macduff's integrity. He assures Macduff of his own virtues and readiness to overthrow Macbeth with the support of English forces. The passage concludes with Malcolm and Macduff uniting to restore Scotland.",1101
"CHORUS. When Faustus had with pleasure ta’en the view
Of rarest things, and royal courts of kings,
He stay’d his course, and so returned home;
Where such as bear his absence but with grief,
I mean his friends and near’st companions,
Did gratulate his safety with kind words,
And in their conference of what befell,
Touching his journey through the world and air,
They put forth questions of astrology,
Which Faustus answer’d with such learned skill
As they admir’d and wonder’d at his wit.
Now is his fame spread forth in every land:
Amongst the rest the Emperor is one,
Carolus the Fifth, at whose palace now
Faustus is feasted ’mongst his noblemen.
What there he did, in trial of his art,
I leave untold; your eyes shall see[’t] perform’d.

ROBIN. O, this is admirable! here I ha’ stolen one of Doctor
Faustus’ conjuring-books, and, i’faith, I mean to search some

parish dance at my pleasure, stark naked, before me; and so
by that means I shall see more than e’er I felt or saw yet.

RALPH. Robin, prithee, come away; there’s a gentleman tarries
to have his horse, and he would have his things rubbed and made
clean: he keeps such a chafing with my mistress about it; and
she has sent me to look thee out; prithee, come away.

ROBIN. Keep out, keep out, or else you are blown up, you are
dismembered, Ralph: keep out, for I am about a roaring piece
of work.

RALPH. Come, what doest thou with that same book? thou canst
not read?

ROBIN. Yes, my master and mistress shall find that I can read,
he for his forehead, she for her private study; she’s born to
bear with me, or else my art fails.

RALPH. Why, Robin, what book is that?

ROBIN. What book! why, the most intolerable book for conjuring
that e’er was invented by any brimstone devil.

RALPH. Canst thou conjure with it?

ROBIN. I can do all these things easily with it; first, I can
make thee drunk with ippocras124 at any tabern125 in Europe
for nothing; that’s one of my conjuring works.

RALPH. Our Master Parson says that’s nothing.

ROBIN. True, Ralph: and more, Ralph, if thou hast any mind to
Nan Spit, our kitchen-maid, then turn her and wind her to thy own
use, as often as thou wilt, and at midnight.

RALPH. O, brave, Robin! shall I have Nan Spit, and to mine own
use? On that condition I’ll feed thy devil with horse-bread as
long as he lives, of free cost.

ROBIN. No more, sweet Ralph: let’s go and make clean our boots,
which lie foul upon our hands, and then to our conjuring in the
devil’s name.

"When Phoebus dwelled here in earth adown,
As olde bookes make mentioun,
He was the moste lusty* bacheler *pleasant
Of all this world, and eke* the best archer. *also
He slew Python the serpent, as he lay
Sleeping against the sun upon a day;
And many another noble worthy deed
He with his bow wrought, as men maye read.
Playen he could on every minstrelsy,
And singe, that it was a melody
To hearen of his cleare voice the soun’.
Certes the king of Thebes, Amphioun,
That with his singing walled the city,
Could never singe half so well as he.
Thereto he was the seemlieste man
That is, or was since that the world began;
What needeth it his features to descrive?
For in this world is none so fair alive.
He was therewith full fill’d of gentleness,
Of honour, and of perfect worthiness.
This Phoebus, that was flower of bach’lery,
As well in freedom* as in chivalry, *generosity
For his disport, in sign eke of victory
Of Python, so as telleth us the story,
Was wont to bearen in his hand a bow.
Now had this Phoebus in his house a crow,
Which in a cage he foster’d many a day,
And taught it speaken, as men teach a jay.
White was this crow, as is a snow-white swan,
And counterfeit the speech of every man
He coulde, when he shoulde tell a tale.
Therewith in all this world no nightingale
Ne coulde by an hundred thousand deal* *part
Singe so wondrous merrily and well.
Now had this Phoebus in his house a wife;
Which that he loved more than his life.
And night and day did ever his diligence
Her for to please, and do her reverence:
Save only, if that I the sooth shall sayn,
Jealous he was, and would have kept her fain.
For him were loth y-japed* for to be; *tricked, deceived
And so is every wight in such degree;
But all for nought, for it availeth nought.
A good wife, that is clean of work and thought,
Should not be kept in none await* certain: *observation
And truely the labour is in vain
To keep a shrewe,* for it will not be. *ill-disposed woman
This hold I for a very nicety,* *sheer folly
To spille* labour for to keepe wives; *lose
Thus writen olde clerkes in their lives.
But now to purpose, as I first began.
This worthy Phoebus did all that he can
To please her, weening, through such pleasance,
And for his manhood and his governance,
That no man should have put him from her grace;
But, God it wot, there may no man embrace
As to distrain* a thing, which that nature *succeed in constraining
Hath naturally set in a creature.
Take any bird, and put it in a cage,
And do all thine intent, and thy corage,* *what thy heart prompts
To foster it tenderly with meat and drink
Of alle dainties that thou canst bethink,
And keep it all so cleanly as thou may;
Although the cage of gold be never so gay,
Yet had this bird, by twenty thousand fold,
Lever* in a forest, both wild and cold, *rather
Go eate wormes, and such wretchedness.
For ever this bird will do his business
T’escape out of his cage when that he may:
His liberty the bird desireth aye. <2>
Let take a cat, and foster her with milk
And tender flesh, and make her couch of silk,
And let her see a mouse go by the wall,

And every dainty that is in that house,
Such appetite hath she to eat the mouse.
Lo, here hath kind* her domination, *nature
And appetite flemeth* discretion. *drives out

Of which there cometh muche harm and woe.
And so befell, when Phoebus was absent,
His wife anon hath for her leman* sent. *unlawful lover
Her leman! certes that is a knavish speech.
Forgive it me, and that I you beseech.
The wise Plato saith, as ye may read,
The word must needs accorde with the deed;
If men shall telle properly a thing,
The word must cousin be to the working.
I am a boistous* man, right thus I say. *rough-spoken, downright
There is no difference truely
Betwixt a wife that is of high degree
(If of her body dishonest she be),
And any poore wench, other than this
(If it so be they worke both amiss),
But, for* the gentle is in estate above, *because
She shall be call’d his lady and his love;
And, for that other is a poor woman,
She shall be call’d his wench and his leman:
And God it wot, mine owen deare brother,
Men lay the one as low as lies the other.
Right so betwixt a *titleless tyrant* *usurper*
And an outlaw, or else a thief errant, *wandering
The same I say, there is no difference
(To Alexander told was this sentence),
But, for the tyrant is of greater might
By force of meinie* for to slay downright, *followers
And burn both house and home, and make all plain,* *level
Lo, therefore is he call’d a capitain;
And, for the outlaw hath but small meinie,
And may not do so great an harm as he,
Nor bring a country to so great mischief,
Men calle him an outlaw or a thief.
But, for I am a man not textuel, *learned in texts
I will not tell of texts never a deal;* *whit
I will go to my tale, as I began.
When Phoebus’ wife had sent for her leman,
Anon they wroughten all their *lust volage.* *light or rash pleasure*
This white crow, that hung aye in the cage,
Beheld their work, and said never a word;
And when that home was come Phoebus the lord,
This crowe sung, “Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo!”
“What? bird,” quoth Phoebus, “what song sing’st thou now?
Wert thou not wont so merrily to sing,
That to my heart it was a rejoicing
To hear thy voice? alas! what song is this?”
“By God,” quoth he, “I singe not amiss.
Phoebus,” quoth he, “for all thy worthiness,
For all thy beauty, and all thy gentleness,
For all thy song, and all thy minstrelsy,
*For all thy waiting, bleared is thine eye* *despite all thy watching,
With one of little reputation, thou art befooled*
Not worth to thee, as in comparison,
The mountance* of a gnat, so may I thrive; *value
For on thy bed thy wife I saw him swive.”
What will ye more? the crow anon him told,
By sade* tokens, and by wordes bold, *grave, trustworthy
How that his wife had done her lechery,
To his great shame and his great villainy;
And told him oft, he saw it with his eyen.
This Phoebus gan awayward for to wrien;* *turn aside
Him thought his woeful hearte burst in two.
His bow he bent, and set therein a flo,* *arrow
And in his ire he hath his wife slain;
This is th’ effect, there is no more to sayn.
For sorrow of which he brake his minstrelsy,
Both harp and lute, gitern* and psaltery; *guitar
And eke he brake his arrows and his bow;
And after that thus spake he to the crow.","In ancient times there lived a man named Phoebus, renowned far and wide for his unparalleled skills as an archer, singer, and musician. Phoebus was not only admired for his talents but also for his noble spirit and kindness. He had a wife of extraordinary beauty, whom he cherished more than anything else. His days were spent in earnest efforts to please her and ensure her happiness, believing that his love would keep her loyal and true. However, his beloved wife was not as faithful as he imagined. Despite Phoebus's unwavering devotion, she allowed herself to be seduced by a man of ill repute, a person undeserving of her affection or the trust of Phoebus. This infidelity did not go unseen, for Phoebus possessed a white crow, a bird of remarkable intelligence that could mimic human speech. The crow, ever observant and faithful to its master, witnessed the wife's betrayal and resolved to inform Phoebus. Upon returning home, Phoebus was greeted by the crow's unsettling revelation. The bird's words struck him like arrows, piercing his heart with the cruel reality of his wife's unfaithfulness. In a moment of overwhelming grief and anger, Phoebus's sorrow turned to rage. The world he had known, filled with music and joy, crumbled around him. Blinded by fury and despair, Phoebus confronted his wife, and in a tragic fit of rage, he ended her life. The blood of his beloved stained his hands, marking the end of his happiness. In his anguish, Phoebus turned on his once cherished instruments and weapons, destroying the very things that had brought him pride and joy. His music ceased, and the harmonious melodies that once filled the air were silenced forever. No longer did his arrow fly true; no longer did his song uplift the spirits. The end of Phoebus's artistic endeavors marked the end of an era, leaving behind a somber reminder of love's fragility and the devastating impact of betrayal.",易,GPT-4o,古文学,英文,"The passage tells the story of Phoebus, an admirable and talented archer, singer, and musician from ancient mythology.

Phoebus had a white crow that could mimic human speech and observed the wife's infidelity. Upon Phoebus's return, the crow revealed the wife's betrayal, causing Phoebus great distress. In a fit of rage, Phoebus killed his wife and destroyed his musical instruments and weapons, marking the end of his happiness and artistic endeavors.",1362

Playen he could on every minstrelsy,
And singe, that it was a melody
To hearen of his cleare voice the soun’.
Certes the king of Thebes, Amphioun,
That with his singing walled the city,
Could never singe half so well as he.
Thereto he was the seemlieste man
That is, or was since that the world began;
What needeth it his features to descrive?
For in this world is none so fair alive.
He was therewith full fill’d of gentleness,
Of honour, and of perfect worthiness.
This Phoebus, that was flower of bach’lery,
As well in freedom* as in chivalry, *generosity
For his disport, in sign eke of victory
Of Python, so as telleth us the story,
Was wont to bearen in his hand a bow.
Now had this Phoebus in his house a crow,
Which in a cage he foster’d many a day,
And taught it speaken, as men teach a jay.
White was this crow, as is a snow-white swan,
And counterfeit the speech of every man
He coulde, when he shoulde tell a tale.
Therewith in all this world no nightingale
Ne coulde by an hundred thousand deal* *part
Singe so wondrous merrily and well.
Now had this Phoebus in his house a wife;
Which that he loved more than his life.
And night and day did ever his diligence
Her for to please, and do her reverence:
Save only, if that I the sooth shall sayn,
Jealous he was, and would have kept her fain.
For him were loth y-japed* for to be; *tricked, deceived
And so is every wight in such degree;
But all for nought, for it availeth nought.
A good wife, that is clean of work and thought,
Should not be kept in none await* certain: *observation
And truely the labour is in vain
To keep a shrewe,* for it will not be. *ill-disposed woman
This hold I for a very nicety,* *sheer folly
To spille* labour for to keepe wives; *lose
Thus writen olde clerkes in their lives.
But now to purpose, as I first began.
This worthy Phoebus did all that he can
To please her, weening, through such pleasance,
And for his manhood and his governance,
That no man should have put him from her grace;
But, God it wot, there may no man embrace
As to distrain* a thing, which that nature *succeed in constraining
Hath naturally set in a creature.
Take any bird, and put it in a cage,
And do all thine intent, and thy corage,* *what thy heart prompts
To foster it tenderly with meat and drink
Of alle dainties that thou canst bethink,
And keep it all so cleanly as thou may;
Although the cage of gold be never so gay,
Yet had this bird, by twenty thousand fold,
Lever* in a forest, both wild and cold, *rather
Go eate wormes, and such wretchedness.
For ever this bird will do his business
T’escape out of his cage when that he may:
His liberty the bird desireth aye. <3>
Let take a cat, and foster her with milk
And tender flesh, and make her couch of silk,
And let her see a mouse go by the wall,

Such appetite hath she to eat the mouse.

On lower things to perform their delight

Never so true, nor so debonair.* *gentle, mild

This Phoebus, which that thought upon no guile,
Deceived was for all his jollity;
For under him another hadde she,
A man of little reputation,
Nought worth to Phoebus in comparison.
The more harm is; it happens often so,
Of which there cometh muche harm and woe.
And so befell, when Phoebus was absent,
His wife anon hath for her leman* sent. *unlawful lover
Her leman! certes that is a knavish speech.
Forgive it me, and that I you beseech.
The wise Plato saith, as ye may read,
The word must needs accorde with the deed;
If men shall telle properly a thing,
The word must cousin be to the working.

There is no difference truely
Betwixt a wife that is of high degree

She shall be call’d his lady and his love;
And, for that other is a poor woman,
She shall be call’d his wench and his leman:
And God it wot, mine owen deare brother,
Men lay the one as low as lies the other.
Right so betwixt a *titleless tyrant* *usurper*
And an outlaw, or else a thief errant, *wandering

Lo, therefore is he call’d a capitain;
And, for the outlaw hath but small meinie,
And may not do so great an harm as he,
Nor bring a country to so great mischief,
Men calle him an outlaw or a thief.
But, for I am a man not textuel, *learned in texts
I will not tell of texts never a deal;* *whit
I will go to my tale, as I began.
When Phoebus’ wife had sent for her leman,
Anon they wroughten all their *lust volage.* *light or rash pleasure*
This white crow, that hung aye in the cage,
Beheld their work, and said never a word;
And when that home was come Phoebus the lord,
This crowe sung, “Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo!”
“What? bird,” quoth Phoebus, “what song sing’st thou now?
Wert thou not wont so merrily to sing,
That to my heart it was a rejoicing
To hear thy voice? alas! what song is this?”
“By God,” quoth he, “I singe not amiss.
Phoebus,” quoth he, “for all thy worthiness,
For all thy beauty, and all thy gentleness,
For all thy song, and all thy minstrelsy,
*For all thy waiting, bleared is thine eye* *despite all thy watching,
With one of little reputation, thou art befooled*
Not worth to thee, as in comparison,

What will ye more? the crow anon him told,
By sade* tokens, and by wordes bold, *grave, trustworthy

To his great shame and his great villainy;
And told him oft, he saw it with his eyen.
This Phoebus gan awayward for to wrien;* *turn aside

His bow he bent, and set therein a flo,* *arrow
And in his ire he hath his wife slain;
This is th’ effect, there is no more to sayn.

"1. No Knowledge without Discernment.
Another faculty we may take notice of in our minds is that of DISCERNING and DISTINGUISHING between the several ideas it has. It is not enough to have a confused perception of something in general. Unless the mind had a distinct perception of different objects and their qualities, it would be capable of very little knowledge, though the bodies that affect us were as busy about us as they are now, and the mind were continually employed in thinking. On this faculty of distinguishing one thing from another depends the evidence and certainty of several, even very general, propositions, which have passed for innate truths;—because men, overlooking the true cause why those propositions find universal assent, impute it wholly to native uniform impressions; whereas it in truth depends upon this clear discerning faculty of the mind, whereby it PERCEIVES two ideas to be the same, or different. But of this more hereafter.
2. The Difference of Wit and Judgment.
How much the imperfection of accurately discriminating ideas one from another lies, either in the dulness or faults of the organs of sense; or want of acuteness, exercise, or attention in the understanding; or hastiness and precipitancy, natural to some tempers, I will not here examine: it suffices to take notice, that this is one of the operations that the mind may reflect on and observe in itself. It is of that consequence to its other knowledge, that so far as this faculty is in itself dull, or not rightly made use of, for the distinguishing one thing from another,—so far our notions are confused, and our reason and judgment disturbed or misled. If in having our ideas in the memory ready at hand consists quickness of parts; in this, of having them unconfused, and being able nicely to distinguish one thing from another, where there is but the least difference, consists, in a great measure, the exactness of judgment, and clearness of reason, which is to be observed in one man above another. And hence perhaps may be given some reason of that common observation,—that men who have a great deal of wit, and prompt memories, have not always the clearest judgment or deepest reason. For WIT lying most in the assemblage of ideas, and putting those together with quickness and variety, wherein can be found any resemblance or congruity, thereby to make up pleasant pictures and agreeable visions in the fancy; JUDGMENT, on the contrary, lies quite on the other side, in separating carefully, one from another, ideas wherein can be found the least difference, thereby to avoid being misled by similitude, and by affinity to take one thing for another. This is a way of proceeding quite contrary to metaphor and allusion; wherein for the most part lies that entertainment and pleasantry of wit, which strikes so lively on the fancy, and therefore is so acceptable to all people, because its beauty appears at first sight, and there is required no labour of thought to examine what truth or reason there is in it. The mind, without looking any further, rests satisfied with the agreeableness of the picture and the gaiety of the fancy. And it is a kind of affront to go about to examine it, by the severe rules of truth and good reason; whereby it appears that it consists in something that is not perfectly conformable to them.
3. Clearness alone hinders Confusion.
To the well distinguishing our ideas, it chiefly contributes that they be CLEAR and DETERMINATE. And when they are so, it will not breed any confusion or mistake about them, though the senses should (as sometimes they do) convey them from the same object differently on different occasions, and so seem to err. For, though a man in a fever should from sugar have a bitter taste, which at another time would produce a sweet one, yet the idea of bitter in that man’s mind would be as clear and distinct from the idea of sweet as if he had tasted only gall. Nor does it make any more confusion between the two ideas of sweet and bitter that the same sort of body produces at one time one, and at another time another idea by the taste, than it makes a confusion in two ideas of white and sweet, or white and round, that the same piece of sugar produces them both in the mind at the same time. And the ideas of orange-colour and azure, that are produced in the mind by the same parcel of the infusion of lignum nephritium, are no less distinct ideas than those of the same colours taken from two very different bodies.
4. Comparing.
The COMPARING them one with another, in respect of extent, degrees, time, place, or any other circumstances, is another operation of the mind about its ideas, and is that upon which depends all that large tribe of ideas comprehended under RELATION; which, of how vast an extent it is, I shall have occasion to consider hereafter.
5. Brutes compare but imperfectly.
How far brutes partake in this faculty, is not easy to determine. I imagine they have it not in any great degree, for, though they probably have several ideas distinct enough, yet it seems to me to be the prerogative of human understanding, when it has sufficiently distinguished any ideas, so as to perceive them to be perfectly different, and so consequently two, to cast about and consider in what circumstances they are capable to be compared. And therefore, I think, beasts compare not their ideas further than some sensible circumstances annexed to the objects themselves. The other power of comparing, which may be observed in men, belonging to general ideas, and useful only to abstract reasonings, we may probably conjecture beasts have not.
6. Compounding.
The next operation we may observe in the mind about its ideas is COMPOSITION; whereby it puts together several of those simple ones it has received from sensation and reflection, and combines them into complex ones. Under this of composition may be reckoned also that of ENLARGING, wherein, though the composition does not so much appear as in more complex ones, yet it is nevertheless a putting several ideas together, though of the same kind. Thus, by adding several units together, we make the idea of a dozen; and putting together the repeated ideas of several perches, we frame that of a furlong.
7. Brutes compound but little.
In this also, I suppose, brutes come far short of man. For, though they take in, and retain together, several combinations of simple ideas, as possibly the shape, smell, and voice of his master make up the complex idea a dog has of him, or rather are so many distinct marks whereby he knows him; yet I do not think they do of themselves ever compound them, and make complex ideas. And perhaps even where we think they have complex ideas, it is only one simple one that directs them in the knowledge of several things, which possibly they distinguish less by their sight than we imagine. For I have been credibly informed that a bitch will nurse, play with, and be fond of young foxes, as much as, and in place of her puppies, if you can but get them once to suck her so long that her milk may go through them. And those animals which have a numerous brood of young ones at once, appear not to have any knowledge of their number; for though they are mightily concerned for any of their young that are taken from them whilst they are in sight or hearing, yet if one or two of them be stolen from them in their absence, or without noise, they appear not to miss them, or to have any sense that their number is lessened.
8. Naming.
When children have, by repeated sensations, got ideas fixed in their memories, they begin by degrees to learn the use of signs. And when they have got the skill to apply the organs of speech to the framing of articulate sounds, they begin to make use of words, to signify their ideas to others. These verbal signs they sometimes borrow from others, and sometimes make themselves, as one may observe among the new and unusual names children often give to things in the first use of language.
9. Abstraction.
The use of words then being to stand as outward mark of our internal ideas, and those ideas being taken from particular things, if every particular idea that we take up should have a distinct name, names must be endless. To prevent this, the mind makes the particular ideas received from particular objects to become general; which is done by considering them as they are in the mind such appearances,—separate from all other existences, and the circumstances of real existence, as time, place, or any other concomitant ideas. This is called ABSTRACTION, whereby ideas taken from particular beings become general representatives of all of the same kind; and their names general names, applicable to whatever exists conformable to such abstract ideas. Such precise, naked appearances in the mind, without considering how, whence, or with what others they came there, the understanding lays up (with names commonly annexed to them) as the standards to rank real existences into sorts, as they agree with these patterns, and to denominate them accordingly. Thus the same colour being observed to-day in chalk or snow, which the mind yesterday received from milk, it considers that appearance alone, makes it a representative of all of that kind; and having given it the name WHITENESS, it by that sound signifies the same quality wheresoever to be imagined or met with; and thus universals, whether ideas or terms, are made.
10. Brutes abstract not.
If it may be doubted whether beasts compound and enlarge their ideas that way to any degree; this, I think, I may be positive in,—that the power of abstracting is not at all in them; and that the having of general ideas is that which puts a perfect distinction betwixt man and brutes, and is an excellency which the faculties of brutes do by no means attain to. For it is evident we observe no footsteps in them of making use of general signs for universal ideas; from which we have reason to imagine that they have not the faculty of abstracting, or making general ideas, since they have no use of words, or any other general signs.","In þisse bec we fon to spræce be þæm gelærednysse mannes modes, and hu he onfengeð ungelicra witunga þe him fremian to gecnawan and to gefremmenne idean.

It emphasizes the importance of discernment and distinguishing among different ideas for knowledge. It also differentiates between wit, which assembles ideas quickly for creative associations, and judgment, which carefully separates and compares ideas for clear reasoning. The clarity of ideas is crucial to avoid confusion, and the ability to compare and contrast these ideas helps form relations and complex ideas. Animals, the passage argues, lack the advanced ability to compare, compound, abstract, and use general ideas as humans do. These capabilities allow humans to create general concepts and terms, facilitating communication and deeper understanding. The passage underscores that the power of abstraction and generalization significantly distinguishes human intellect from that of animals.",1757

Nor does it make any more confusion between the two ideas of sweet and bitter that the same sort of body produces at one time one, and at another time another idea by the taste, than it makes a confusion in two ideas of white and sweet, or white and round, that the same piece of sugar produces them both in the mind at the same time. And the ideas of orange-colour and azure, that are produced in the mind by the same parcel of the infusion of lignum nephritium, are no less distinct ideas than those of the same colours taken from two very different bodies.
4. Comparing.
The COMPARING them one with another, in respect of extent, degrees, time, place, or any other circumstances, is another operation of the mind about its ideas, and is that upon which depends all that large tribe of ideas comprehended under RELATION; which, of how vast an extent it is, I shall have occasion to consider hereafter.
5. Brutes compare but imperfectly.
How far brutes partake in this faculty, is not easy to determine. I imagine they have it not in any great degree, for, though they probably have several ideas distinct enough, yet it seems to me to be the prerogative of human understanding, when it has sufficiently distinguished any ideas, so as to perceive them to be perfectly different, and so consequently two, to cast about and consider in what circumstances they are capable to be compared. And therefore, I think, beasts compare not their ideas further than some sensible circumstances annexed to the objects themselves. The other power of comparing, which may be observed in men, belonging to general ideas, and useful only to abstract reasonings, we may probably conjecture beasts have not.
6. Compounding.
The next operation we may observe in the mind about its ideas is COMPOSITION; whereby it puts together several of those simple ones it has received from sensation and reflection, and combines them into complex ones. Under this of composition may be reckoned also that of ENLARGING, wherein, though the composition does not so much appear as in more complex ones, yet it is nevertheless a putting several ideas together, though of the same kind. Thus, by adding several units together, we make the idea of a dozen; and putting together the repeated ideas of several perches, we frame that of a furlong.
7. Brutes compound but little.
In this also, I suppose, brutes come far short of man. For, though they take in, and retain together, several combinations of simple ideas, as possibly the shape, smell, and voice of his master make up the complex idea a dog has of him, or rather are so many distinct marks whereby he knows him; yet I do not think they do of themselves ever compound them, and make complex ideas. And perhaps even where we think they have complex ideas, it is only one simple one that directs them in the knowledge of several things, which possibly they distinguish less by their sight than we imagine. For I have been credibly informed that a bitch will nurse, play with, and be fond of young foxes, as much as, and in place of her puppies, if you can but get them once to suck her so long that her milk may go through them. And those animals which have a numerous brood of young ones at once, appear not to have any knowledge of their number; for though they are mightily concerned for any of their young that are taken from them whilst they are in sight or hearing, yet if one or two of them be stolen from them in their absence, or without noise, they appear not to miss them, or to have any sense that their number is lessened.
8. Naming.
When children have, by repeated sensations, got ideas fixed in their memories, they begin by degrees to learn the use of signs. And when they have got the skill to apply the organs of speech to the framing of articulate sounds, they begin to make use of words, to signify their ideas to others. These verbal signs they sometimes borrow from others, and sometimes make themselves, as one may observe among the new and unusual names children often give to things in the first use of language.
9. Abstraction.
The use of words then being to stand as outward mark of our internal ideas, and those ideas being taken from particular things, if every particular idea that we take up should have a distinct name, names must be endless. To prevent this, the mind makes the particular ideas received from particular objects to become general; which is done by considering them as they are in the mind such appearances,—separate from all other existences, and the circumstances of real existence, as time, place, or any other concomitant ideas. This is called ABSTRACTION, whereby ideas taken from particular beings become general representatives of all of the same kind; and their names general names, applicable to whatever exists conformable to such abstract ideas. Such precise, naked appearances in the mind, without considering how, whence, or with what others they came there, the understanding lays up (with names commonly annexed to them) as the standards to rank real existences into sorts, as they agree with these patterns, and to denominate them accordingly. Thus the same colour being observed to-day in chalk or snow, which the mind yesterday received from milk, it considers that appearance alone, makes it a representative of all of that kind; and having given it the name WHITENESS, it by that sound signifies the same quality wheresoever to be imagined or met with; and thus universals, whether ideas or terms, are made.
11. Brutes abstract not.
If it may be doubted whether beasts compound and enlarge their ideas that way to any degree; this, I think, I may be positive in,—that the power of abstracting is not at all in them; and that the having of general ideas is that which puts a perfect distinction betwixt man and brutes, and is an excellency which the faculties of brutes do by no means attain to. For it is evident we observe no footsteps in them of making use of general signs for universal ideas; from which we have reason to imagine that they have not the faculty of abstracting, or making general ideas, since they have no use of words, or any other general signs.",,,GPT-4o,古文学,英文,"This passage explores various mental faculties that humans possess which enable them to gain knowledge and form ideas. It emphasizes the importance of discernment and distinguishing among different ideas for knowledge. It also differentiates between wit, which assembles ideas quickly for creative associations, and judgment, which carefully separates and compares ideas for clear reasoning. The clarity of ideas is crucial to avoid confusion, and the ability to compare and contrast these ideas helps form relations and complex ideas. Animals, the passage argues, lack the advanced ability to compare, compound, abstract, and use general ideas as humans do. These capabilities allow humans to create general concepts and terms, facilitating communication and deeper understanding. The passage underscores that the power of abstraction and generalization significantly distinguishes human intellect from that of animals.",1757
"1. No Knowledge without Discernment.
Another faculty we may take notice of in our minds is that of DISCERNING and DISTINGUISHING between the several ideas it has. It is not enough to have a confused perception of something in general. Unless the mind had a distinct perception of different objects and their qualities, it would be capable of very little knowledge, though the bodies that affect us were as busy about us as they are now, and the mind were continually employed in thinking. On this faculty of distinguishing one thing from another depends the evidence and certainty of several, even very general, propositions, which have passed for innate truths;—because men, overlooking the true cause why those propositions find universal assent, impute it wholly to native uniform impressions; whereas it in truth depends upon this clear discerning faculty of the mind, whereby it PERCEIVES two ideas to be the same, or different. But of this more hereafter.
2. The Difference of Wit and Judgment.
How much the imperfection of accurately discriminating ideas one from another lies, either in the dulness or faults of the organs of sense; or want of acuteness, exercise, or attention in the understanding; or hastiness and precipitancy, natural to some tempers, I will not here examine: it suffices to take notice, that this is one of the operations that the mind may reflect on and observe in itself. It is of that consequence to its other knowledge, that so far as this faculty is in itself dull, or not rightly made use of, for the distinguishing one thing from another,—so far our notions are confused, and our reason and judgment disturbed or misled. If in having our ideas in the memory ready at hand consists quickness of parts; in this, of having them unconfused, and being able nicely to distinguish one thing from another, where there is but the least difference, consists, in a great measure, the exactness of judgment, and clearness of reason, which is to be observed in one man above another. And hence perhaps may be given some reason of that common observation,—that men who have a great deal of wit, and prompt memories, have not always the clearest judgment or deepest reason. For WIT lying most in the assemblage of ideas, and putting those together with quickness and variety, wherein can be found any resemblance or congruity, thereby to make up pleasant pictures and agreeable visions in the fancy; JUDGMENT, on the contrary, lies quite on the other side, in separating carefully, one from another, ideas wherein can be found the least difference, thereby to avoid being misled by similitude, and by affinity to take one thing for another. This is a way of proceeding quite contrary to metaphor and allusion; wherein for the most part lies that entertainment and pleasantry of wit, which strikes so lively on the fancy, and therefore is so acceptable to all people, because its beauty appears at first sight, and there is required no labour of thought to examine what truth or reason there is in it. The mind, without looking any further, rests satisfied with the agreeableness of the picture and the gaiety of the fancy. And it is a kind of affront to go about to examine it, by the severe rules of truth and good reason; whereby it appears that it consists in something that is not perfectly conformable to them.
3. Clearness alone hinders Confusion.
To the well distinguishing our ideas, it chiefly contributes that they be CLEAR and DETERMINATE. And when they are so, it will not breed any confusion or mistake about them, though the senses should (as sometimes they do) convey them from the same object differently on different occasions, and so seem to err. For, though a man in a fever should from sugar have a bitter taste, which at another time would produce a sweet one, yet the idea of bitter in that man’s mind would be as clear and distinct from the idea of sweet as if he had tasted only gall. Nor does it make any more confusion between the two ideas of sweet and bitter that the same sort of body produces at one time one, and at another time another idea by the taste, than it makes a confusion in two ideas of white and sweet, or white and round, that the same piece of sugar produces them both in the mind at the same time. And the ideas of orange-colour and azure, that are produced in the mind by the same parcel of the infusion of lignum nephritium, are no less distinct ideas than those of the same colours taken from two very different bodies.
4. Comparing.
The COMPARING them one with another, in respect of extent, degrees, time, place, or any other circumstances, is another operation of the mind about its ideas, and is that upon which depends all that large tribe of ideas comprehended under RELATION; which, of how vast an extent it is, I shall have occasion to consider hereafter.

I fear me 'tis about fair Abigail.

KATHARINE. Tell me, Mathias, is not that the Jew?

BARABAS. As for the comment on the Maccabees,
I have it, sir, and 'tis at your command.

Thy birth, condition, and profession.

ITHAMORE. Faith, sir, my birth is but mean; my name's Ithamore;
my profession what you please.

BARABAS. Hast thou no trade? then listen to my words,
And I will teach [thee] that shall stick by thee:
First, be thou void of these affections,
Compassion, love, vain hope, and heartless fear;
Be mov'd at nothing, see thou pity none,
But to thyself smile when the Christians moan.

ITHAMORE. O, brave, master! 78 I worship your nose 79 for this.

BARABAS. As for myself, I walk abroad o' nights,
And kill sick people groaning under walls:
Sometimes I go about and poison wells;
And now and then, to cherish Christian thieves,
I am content to lose some of my crowns,
That I may, walking in my gallery,
See 'em go pinion'd along by my door.

To practice first upon the Italian;
There I enrich'd the priests with burials,
And always kept the sexton's arms in ure 80
With digging graves and ringing dead men's knells:
And, after that, was I an engineer,
And in the wars 'twixt France and Germany,
Under pretence of helping Charles the Fifth,
Slew friend and enemy with my stratagems:
Then, after that, was I an usurer,
And with extorting, cozening, forfeiting,
And tricks belonging unto brokery,
I fill'd the gaols with bankrupts in a year,
And with young orphans planted hospitals;
And every moon made some or other mad,
And now and then one hang himself for grief,
Pinning upon his breast a long great scroll
How I with interest tormented him.
But mark how I am blest for plaguing them;—
I have as much coin as will buy the town.
But tell me now, how hast thou spent thy time?

ITHAMORE. Faith, master,
In setting Christian villages on fire,
Chaining of eunuchs, binding galley-slaves.
One time I was an hostler in an inn,
And in the night-time secretly would I steal
To travellers' chambers, and there cut their throats:
Once at Jerusalem, where the pilgrims kneel'd,
I strewed powder on the marble stones,
And therewithal their knees would rankle so,
That I have laugh'd a-good 81 to see the cripples
Go limping home to Christendom on stilts.

BARABAS. Why, this is something: make account of me
As of thy fellow; we are villains both;
Both circumcised; we hate Christians both:
Be true and secret; thou shalt want no gold.
But stand aside; here comes Don Lodowick.

Where is the diamond you told me of?

BARABAS. I have it for you, sir: please you walk in with me.—

For now by this has he kiss'd Abigail,
And she vows love to him, and he to her.
As sure as heaven rain'd manna for the Jews,
So sure shall he and Don Mathias die:
His father was my chiefest enemy.","On Mathias and Katharine's arrival, Barabas and Lodowick were deep in secretive conversation. Mathias, ever the vigilant lover, suspected their words revolved around his beloved Abigail. He felt unease gnawing at his heart, for Barabas had a cunning glint in his eye. The young lover voiced his suspicions to Katharine, who shared his concern. Their conversation was abruptly interrupted as Barabas, with a sly smile, diverted their attention, claiming their words were about diamonds, not Abigail. Mathias, though skeptical, held his tongue, not wanting to precipitate a confrontation just yet.

Once Katharine and Mathias moved a bit away, Barabas slipped into the shadows to meet Ithamore. There, away from prying eyes, he revealed his malevolent plan. He began to instruct Ithamore, weaving tales of his own wicked past. Ithamore listened intently, eager to learn the dark arts of villainy. Barabas outlined the depths of betrayal and deceit, recruiting Ithamore fully into his sinister endeavors.

As their cloak-and-dagger session ended, Lodowick approached, inquiring about a diamond. Barabas, ever the manipulator, directed his daughter Abigail to entertain Lodowick deceitfully. Abigail, caught in the web of her father's machinations, obeyed reluctantly. Her heart yearned for Mathias, yet she had little choice but to play along.

Barabas, hidden from the others, watched his plans unfold. His ambition was not merely to deceive but to destroy. He intended to set a deadly rivalry between Lodowick and Mathias, orchestrating events so both would meet their tragic end. By doing so, he sought not just personal revenge but a broader retribution against the governor, whom he despised deeply. The scene was set for a treacherous play of love, deceit, and death, where Barabas pulled the strings skilfully and remorselessly.",易,GPT-4o,古文学,英文,"In this passage, Mathias and Katharine enter while Barabas and Lodowick are discussing something secretly.

And be reveng'd upon the—governor.
[Aside.]
[Exit LODOWICK.]

KATHARINE. This Moor is comeliest, is he not? speak, son.

MATHIAS. No, this is the better, mother, view this well.

BARABAS. Seem not to know me here before your mother,
Lest she mistrust the match that is in hand:
When you have brought her home, come to my house;
Think of me as thy father: son, farewell.

MATHIAS. But wherefore talk'd Don Lodowick with you?

BARABAS. Tush, man! we talk'd of diamonds, not of Abigail.

KATHARINE. Tell me, Mathias, is not that the Jew?

BARABAS. As for the comment on the Maccabees,
I have it, sir, and 'tis at your command.

MATHIAS. Yes, madam, and my talk with him was 77
About the borrowing of a book or two.

KATHARINE. Converse not with him; he is cast off from heaven.—
Thou hast thy crowns, fellow.—Come, let's away.

MATHIAS. Sirrah Jew, remember the book.

BARABAS. Marry, will I, sir.
[Exeunt KATHARlNE and MATHIAS.]

FIRST OFFICER. Come, I have made a reasonable market; let's away.
[Exeunt OFFICERS with SLAVES.]

BARABAS. Now let me know thy name, and therewithal
Thy birth, condition, and profession.

ITHAMORE. Faith, sir, my birth is but mean; my name's Ithamore;
my profession what you please.

BARABAS. Hast thou no trade? then listen to my words,
And I will teach [thee] that shall stick by thee:
First, be thou void of these affections,
Compassion, love, vain hope, and heartless fear;
Be mov'd at nothing, see thou pity none,
But to thyself smile when the Christians moan.

ITHAMORE. O, brave, master! 78 I worship your nose 79 for this.

BARABAS. As for myself, I walk abroad o' nights,
And kill sick people groaning under walls:
Sometimes I go about and poison wells;
And now and then, to cherish Christian thieves,
I am content to lose some of my crowns,
That I may, walking in my gallery,
See 'em go pinion'd along by my door.
Being young, I studied physic, and began
To practice first upon the Italian;
There I enrich'd the priests with burials,
And always kept the sexton's arms in ure 80
With digging graves and ringing dead men's knells:
And, after that, was I an engineer,
And in the wars 'twixt France and Germany,
Under pretence of helping Charles the Fifth,
Slew friend and enemy with my stratagems:
Then, after that, was I an usurer,
And with extorting, cozening, forfeiting,
And tricks belonging unto brokery,
I fill'd the gaols with bankrupts in a year,
And with young orphans planted hospitals;
And every moon made some or other mad,
And now and then one hang himself for grief,
Pinning upon his breast a long great scroll
How I with interest tormented him.
But mark how I am blest for plaguing them;—
I have as much coin as will buy the town.
But tell me now, how hast thou spent thy time?

ITHAMORE. Faith, master,
In setting Christian villages on fire,
Chaining of eunuchs, binding galley-slaves.
One time I was an hostler in an inn,
And in the night-time secretly would I steal
To travellers' chambers, and there cut their throats:
Once at Jerusalem, where the pilgrims kneel'd,
I strewed powder on the marble stones,
And therewithal their knees would rankle so,
That I have laugh'd a-good 81 to see the cripples
Go limping home to Christendom on stilts.

BARABAS. Why, this is something: make account of me
As of thy fellow; we are villains both;
Both circumcised; we hate Christians both:
Be true and secret; thou shalt want no gold.
But stand aside; here comes Don Lodowick.

Enter LODOWICK. 82

LODOWICK. O, Barabas, well met;
Where is the diamond you told me of?

BARABAS. I have it for you, sir: please you walk in with me.—
What, ho, Abigail! open the door, I say!

Enter ABIGAIL, with letters.

ABIGAIL. In good time, father; here are letters come
]From Ormus, and the post stays here within.

BARABAS. Give me the letters.—Daughter, do you hear?
Entertain Lodowick, the governor's son,
With all the courtesy you can afford,
Provided that you keep your maidenhead:
Use him as if he were a Philistine;
Dissemble, swear, protest, vow love to him: 83
He is not of the seed of Abraham.—
[Aside to her.]
I am a little busy, sir; pray, pardon me.—
Abigail, bid him welcome for my sake.

ABIGAIL. For your sake and his own he's welcome hither.

BARABAS. Daughter, a word more: kiss him, speak him fair,
And like a cunning Jew so cast about,
That ye be both made sure 84 ere you come out.
[Aside to her.]

ABIGAIL. O father, Don Mathias is my love!

BARABAS. I know it: yet, I say, make love to him;
Do, it is requisite it should be so.—
[Aside to her.]
Nay, on my life, it is my factor's hand;
But go you in, I'll think upon the account.
[Exeunt ABIGAIL and LODOWICK into the house.]
The account is made, for Lodovico 85 dies.
My factor sends me word a merchant's fled
That owes me for a hundred tun of wine:
I weigh it thus much[snapping his fingers]! I have wealth enough;
For now by this has he kiss'd Abigail,
And she vows love to him, and he to her.
As sure as heaven rain'd manna for the Jews,
So sure shall he and Don Mathias die:
His father was my chiefest enemy.",,,GPT-4o,古文学,英文,"In this passage, Mathias and Katharine enter while Barabas and Lodowick are discussing something secretly. Mathias suspects their conversation concerns Abigail, whom he loves. Barabas, however, has malicious plans to thwart Mathias' love for Abigail and aims to take revenge on the governor. Katharine is warned by Mathias about their interaction with Barabas, who lies about discussing diamonds instead of Abigail. Barabas then meets Ithamore and recruits him, outlining his own malevolent history and instructing Ithamore on how to become a villain like him. Lodowick appears asking about a diamond, and Barabas instructs his daughter Abigail to deceitfully entertain Lodowick, despite her love for Mathias. Barabas plans to have both Lodowick and Mathias killed as part of his broader scheme for revenge.",960

Keeping his kingly body in a cage,

Should have prepar'd to entertain his grace?
And treading him beneath thy loathsome feet,

Shall sit by him, and starve to death himself:

To fair Damascus, where we now remain,

","Upon his gilded throne, Tamburlaine did sit, surveying all with a gaze as fierce as flame. With a resounding voice, he proclaimed his dominance over all emperors and even the very heavens. Reflecting on his numerous victories, he vowed that the skies would soon blaze with fire and be filled with chaos wrought by his hand. His words, forceful and brimming with hubris, rang through the hall, unchallenged but for the bitter voice of Zabina. With anguish and fury, she rebuked Tamburlaine, decrying his cruelty and tyranny inflicted upon her husband, Bajazeth, once an emperor but now a wretched captive in a cage. Techelles, ever loyal and eager to please, advised Tamburlaine to further punish the captives, adding to their misery. At the same moment, Zenocrate turned to her handmaid Anippe, commanding her to silence the mournful cries of Zabina. Bajazeth, though bound and weakened, spoke of retribution to come; but Tamburlaine, with his unshakeable resolve, reasserted his control. He decreed that Bajazeth would remain caged and be fed nothing but scraps, a living testament to Tamburlaine's power. With burning ambition, Tamburlaine set his sights on Damascus, declaring his intent to conquer it with no mercy, despite Zenocrate's pleas for the sake of her homeland and father.

And therfore hated of the Protestants.

To overthrow those factious Puritans:
And know, the Pope will sell his triple crowne,

Ere I shall want, will cause his Indians,
To rip the golden bowels of America.

Shall feele the house of Lorayne is his foe:
Your highnes need not feare mine armies force,
Tis for your safetie and your enemies wrack.

And as Dictator make or warre or peace,

Dismisse thy campe or else by our Edict,
Be thou proclaimde a traitor throughout France.

I kisse your graces hand, and take my leave,
Intending to dislodge my campe with speed.

For had your highnesse seene with what a pompe
He entred Paris, and how the Citizens
With gifts and shewes did entertaine him
And promised to be at his commaund:
Nay, they fear'd not to speak in the streetes,
That Guise ch, durst stand in armes against the King,
For not effecting of his holines will.

KING. Did they of Paris entertaine him so?
Then meanes he present treason to our state.
Well, let me alone, whose within there?

Enter one with e pen and inke.

Make a discharge of all my counsell straite,
And Ile subscribe my name and seale it straight.
My head shall be my counsell, they are false:
And Epernoune I will be rulde by thee.

It would be good the Guise were made away,
And so to quite your grace of all suspect.

KING. First let us set our hand and seale to this,
And then Ile tell thee what I meane to doe.

He writes.

So, convey this to the counsell presently.

Exit one.

And Epernoune though I seeme milde and calme,
Thinke not but I am tragicall within:
Ile secretly convey me unto Bloyse,
For now that Paris takes the Guises parse,
Heere is not staying for the King of France,
Unles he means to be betraide and dye:

"KING. My Lord of Guise, we understand that you
Have gathered a power of men.
What your intent is yet we cannot learn,
But we presume it is not for our good.

GUISE. Why I am no traitor to the crowne of France.
What I have done tis for the Gospel's sake.

EPERNOUNE. Nay for the Popes sake, and shine owne benefite.
What Peere in France but thou (aspiring Guise)
Durst be in armes without the Kings consent?
I challenge thee for treason in the cause.

GUISE. Oh base Epernoune, were not his highnes heere,
Thou shouldst perceive the Duke of Guise is mov'd.

KING. Be patient Guise and threat not Epernoune,
Least thou perceive the King of France be mov'd.

GUISE. Why? I am a Prince of the Valoyses line,
Therfore an enemy to the Burbonites.
I am a juror in the holy league,
And therfore hated of the Protestants.
What should I doe but stand upon my guarde?
And being able, Ile keep an hoast in pay.

EPERNOUNE. Thou able to maintaine an hoast in pay,
That livest by forraine exhibition?
The Pope and King of Spaine are thy good frends,
Else all France knowes how poor a Duke thou art.

KING. I, those are they that feed him with their golde,
To countermaund our will and check our freends.

GUISE. My Lord, to speak more plainely, thus it is:
Being animated by Religious zeale,
I meane to muster all the power I can,
To overthrow those factious Puritans:
And know, the Pope will sell his triple crowne,
I, and the catholick Philip King of Spaine,
Ere I shall want, will cause his Indians,
To rip the golden bowels of America.
Navarre that cloakes them underneath his wings,
Shall feele the house of Lorayne is his foe:
Your highnes need not feare mine armies force,
Tis for your safetie and your enemies wrack.

KING. Guise, weare our crowne, and be thou King of France,
And as Dictator make or warre or peace,
Whilste I cry placet like a Senator.
I cannot brook thy hauty insolence,
Dismisse thy campe or else by our Edict,
Be thou proclaimde a traitor throughout France.

GUISE. The choyse is hard, I must dissemble.

[Aside.]

My Lord, in token of my true humilitie,
And simple meaning to your Majestie,
I kisse your graces hand, and take my leave,
Intending to dislodge my campe with speed.

KING. Then farwell Guise, the King and thou art freends.

Exit Guise.

EPERNOUNE. But trust him not my Lord,
For had your highnesse seene with what a pompe
He entred Paris, and how the Citizens
With gifts and shewes did entertaine him
And promised to be at his commaund:
Nay, they fear'd not to speak in the streetes,
That Guise ch, durst stand in armes against the King,
For not effecting of his holines will.

KING. Did they of Paris entertaine him so?
Then meanes he present treason to our state.
Well, let me alone, whose within there?

Enter one with e pen and inke.

Make a discharge of all my counsell straite,
And Ile subscribe my name and seale it straight.
My head shall be my counsell, they are false:
And Epernoune I will be rulde by thee.

EPERNOUNE. My Lord,
I think for safety of your person,
It would be good the Guise were made away,
And so to quite your grace of all suspect.

KING. First let us set our hand and seale to this,
And then Ile tell thee what I meane to doe.

He writes.

So, convey this to the counsell presently.

Exit one.

And Epernoune though I seeme milde and calme,
Thinke not but I am tragicall within:
Ile secretly convey me unto Bloyse,
For now that Paris takes the Guises parse,
Heere is not staying for the King of France,
Unles he means to be betraide and dye:
But as I live, so sure the Guise shall dye.

"What dire offence from am'rous causes springs,
What mighty contests rise from trivial things,
I sing — This verse to Caryl, Muse! is due:
This, ev'n Belinda may vouchsafe to view:
Slight is the subject, but not so the praise,
If She inspire, and He approve my lays.

Say what strange motive, Goddess! could compel
A well-bred Lord t' assault a gentle Belle?
O say what stranger cause, yet unexplor'd,
Could make a gentle Belle reject a Lord?
In tasks so bold, can little men engage,
And in soft bosoms dwells such mighty Rage?

Sol thro' white curtains shot a tim'rous ray,
And oped those eyes that must eclipse the day:
Now lap-dogs give themselves the rousing shake,
And sleepless lovers, just at twelve, awake:
Thrice rung the bell, the slipper knock'd the ground,
And the press'd watch return'd a silver sound.
Belinda still her downy pillow prest,
Her guardian Sylph prolong'd the balmy rest:
'Twas He had summon'd to her silent bed
The morning-dream that hover'd o'er her head;
A Youth more glitt'ring than a Birth-night Beau,
(That ev'n in slumber caus'd her cheek to glow)
Seem'd to her ear his winning lips to lay,
And thus in whispers said, or seem'd to say.
Fairest of mortals, thou distinguish'd care
Of thousand bright Inhabitants of Air!
If e'er one vision touch.'d thy infant thought,
Of all the Nurse and all the Priest have taught;
Of airy Elves by moonlight shadows seen,
The silver token, and the circled green,
Or virgins visited by Angel-pow'rs,
With golden crowns and wreaths of heav'nly flow'rs;
Hear and believe! thy own importance know,
Nor bound thy narrow views to things below.
Some secret truths, from learned pride conceal'd,
To Maids alone and Children are reveal'd:
What tho' no credit doubting Wits may give?
The Fair and Innocent shall still believe.
Know, then, unnumber'd Spirits round thee fly,
The light Militia of the lower sky:
These, tho' unseen, are ever on the wing,
Hang o'er the Box, and hover round the Ring.
Think what an equipage thou hast in Air,
And view with scorn two Pages and a Chair.
As now your own, our beings were of old,
And once inclos'd in Woman's beauteous mould;
Thence, by a soft transition, we repair
From earthly Vehicles to these of air.
Think not, when Woman's transient breath is fled
That all her vanities at once are dead;
Succeeding vanities she still regards,
And tho' she plays no more, o'erlooks the cards.
Her joy in gilded Chariots, when alive,
And love of Ombre, after death survive.
For when the Fair in all their pride expire,
To their first Elements their Souls retire:
The Sprites of fiery Termagants in Flame
Mount up, and take a Salamander's name.
Soft yielding minds to Water glide away,
And sip, with Nymphs, their elemental Tea.
The graver Prude sinks downward to a Gnome,
In search of mischief still on Earth to roam.
The light Coquettes in Sylphs aloft repair,
And sport and flutter in the fields of Air.","Hwæt! In gemyndigdagum, þær wæs ænig hlaford from þa rice essexum, þa he wolde mid leohte mod his luffe on Belindan yrnan þurbeman þære heofona tungel.

"May I for my own self song’s truth reckon,
Journey’s jargon, how I in harsh days
Hardship endured oft.
Bitter breast-cares have I abided,
Known on my keel many a care’s hold,
And dire sea-surge, and there I oft spent
Narrow nightwatch nigh the ship’s head
While she tossed close to cliffs. Coldly afflicted,
My feet were by frost benumbed.
Chill its chains are; chafing sighs
Hew my heart round and hunger begot
Mere-weary mood. Lest man know not
That he on dry land loveliest liveth,
List how I, care-wretched, on ice-cold sea,
Weathered the winter, wretched outcast
Deprived of my kinsmen;
Hung with hard ice-flakes, where hail-scur flew,
There I heard naught save the harsh sea
And ice-cold wave, at whiles the swan cries,
Did for my games the gannet’s clamour,
Sea-fowls, loudness was for me laughter,
The mews' singing all my mead-drink.
Storms, on the stone-cliffs beaten, fell on the stern
In icy feathers; full oft the eagle screamed
With spray on his pinion.
Not any protector
May make merry man faring needy.
This he little believes, who aye in winsome life
Abides ’mid burghers some heavy business,
Wealthy and wine-flushed, how I weary oft
Must bide above brine.
Neareth nightshade, snoweth from north,
Frost froze the land, hail fell on earth then
Corn of the coldest. Nathless there knocketh now
The heart's thought that I on high streams
The salt-wavy tumult traverse alone.
Moaneth alway my mind’s lust
That I fare forth, that I afar hence
Seek out a foreign fastness.
For this there’s no mood-lofty man over earth’s midst,
Not though he be given his good, but will have in his youth greed;
Nor his deed to the daring, nor his king to the faithful
But shall have his sorrow for sea-fare
Whatever his lord will.
He hath not heart for harping, nor in ring-having
Nor winsomeness to wife, nor world's delight
Nor any whit else save the wave's slash,
Yet longing comes upon him to fare forth on the water.
Bosque taketh blossom, cometh beauty of berries,
Fields to fairness, land fares brisker,
All this admonisheth man eager of mood,
The heart turns to travel so that he then thinks
On flood-ways to be far departing.
Cuckoo calleth with gloomy crying,
He singeth summerward, bodeth sorrow,
The bitter heart's blood. Burgher knows not —
He the prosperous man — what some perform
Where wandering them widest draweth.
So that but now my heart burst from my breast-lock,
My mood ’mid the mere-flood,
Over the whale’s acre, would wander wide.
On earth’s shelter cometh oft to me,
Eager and ready, the crying lone-flyer,
Whets for the whale-path the heart irresistibly,
O'er tracks of ocean; seeing that anyhow
My lord deems to me this dead life
On loan and on land, I believe not
That any earth-weal eternal standeth
Save there be somewhat calamitous
That, ere a man’s tide go, turn it to twain.
Disease or oldness or sword-hate
Beats out the breath from doom-gripped body.
And for this, every earl whatever, for those speaking after —
Laud of the living, boasteth some last word,
That he will work ere he pass onward,
Frame on the fair earth ’gainst foes his malice,
Daring ado, ...
So that all men shall honour him after
And his laud beyond them remain ’mid the English,
Aye, for ever, a lasting life’s-blast,
Delight mid the doughty.
Days little durable,
And all arrogance of earthen riches,
There come now no kings nor Cæsars
Nor gold-giving lords like those gone.
Howe’er in mirth most magnified,
Whoe’er lived in life most lordliest,
Drear all this excellence, delights undurable!
Waneth the watch, but the world holdeth.
Tomb hideth trouble. The blade is layed low.
Earthly glory ageth and seareth.
No man at all going the earth’s gait,
But age fares against him, his face paleth,
Grey-haired he groaneth, knows gone companions,
Lordly men are to earth o’ergiven,
Nor may he then the flesh-cover, whose life ceaseth,
Nor eat the sweet nor feel the sorry,
Nor stir hand nor think in mid heart,
And though he strew the grave with gold,
His born brothers, their buried bodies
Be an unlikely treasure hoard.","Ic, sē sǣfara, āne wīþ wæges sār hæbbend ond earfoðe langne sīþ her ætforan eordan līce, in winnende eallum þām stormum ond wintercearige, þrittig wintera wæge oft hrēohmultum winnande on scyppfætnisse mec sylfa socende.

Chill its chains are; chafing sighs
Hew my heart round and hunger begot
Mere-weary mood. Lest man know not
That he on dry land loveliest liveth,
List how I, care-wretched, on ice-cold sea,
Weathered the winter, wretched outcast
Deprived of my kinsmen;
Hung with hard ice-flakes, where hail-scur flew,
There I heard naught save the harsh sea
And ice-cold wave, at whiles the swan cries,
Did for my games the gannet’s clamour,
Sea-fowls, loudness was for me laughter,
The mews' singing all my mead-drink.
Storms, on the stone-cliffs beaten, fell on the stern
In icy feathers; full oft the eagle screamed
With spray on his pinion.
Not any protector
May make merry man faring needy.
This he little believes, who aye in winsome life
Abides ’mid burghers some heavy business,
Wealthy and wine-flushed, how I weary oft
Must bide above brine.
Neareth nightshade, snoweth from north,
Frost froze the land, hail fell on earth then
Corn of the coldest. Nathless there knocketh now
The heart's thought that I on high streams
The salt-wavy tumult traverse alone.
Moaneth alway my mind’s lust
That I fare forth, that I afar hence
Seek out a foreign fastness.
For this there’s no mood-lofty man over earth’s midst,
Not though he be given his good, but will have in his youth greed;
Nor his deed to the daring, nor his king to the faithful
But shall have his sorrow for sea-fare
Whatever his lord will.
He hath not heart for harping, nor in ring-having
Nor winsomeness to wife, nor world's delight
Nor any whit else save the wave's slash,
Yet longing comes upon him to fare forth on the water.
Bosque taketh blossom, cometh beauty of berries,
Fields to fairness, land fares brisker,
All this admonisheth man eager of mood,
The heart turns to travel so that he then thinks
On flood-ways to be far departing.
Cuckoo calleth with gloomy crying,
He singeth summerward, bodeth sorrow,
The bitter heart's blood. Burgher knows not —
He the prosperous man — what some perform
Where wandering them widest draweth.
So that but now my heart burst from my breast-lock,
My mood ’mid the mere-flood,
Over the whale’s acre, would wander wide.
On earth’s shelter cometh oft to me,
Eager and ready, the crying lone-flyer,
Whets for the whale-path the heart irresistibly,
O'er tracks of ocean; seeing that anyhow
My lord deems to me this dead life
On loan and on land, I believe not
That any earth-weal eternal standeth
Save there be somewhat calamitous
That, ere a man’s tide go, turn it to twain.
Disease or oldness or sword-hate
Beats out the breath from doom-gripped body.
And for this, every earl whatever, for those speaking after —
Laud of the living, boasteth some last word,
That he will work ere he pass onward,
Frame on the fair earth ’gainst foes his malice,
Daring ado, ...
So that all men shall honour him after
And his laud beyond them remain ’mid the English,
Aye, for ever, a lasting life’s-blast,
Delight mid the doughty.
Days little durable,
And all arrogance of earthen riches,
There come now no kings nor Cæsars
Nor gold-giving lords like those gone.
Howe’er in mirth most magnified,
Whoe’er lived in life most lordliest,
Drear all this excellence, delights undurable!
Waneth the watch, but the world holdeth.
Tomb hideth trouble. The blade is layed low.
Earthly glory ageth and seareth.
No man at all going the earth’s gait,
But age fares against him, his face paleth,
Grey-haired he groaneth, knows gone companions,
Lordly men are to earth o’ergiven,
Nor may he then the flesh-cover, whose life ceaseth,
Nor eat the sweet nor feel the sorry,
Nor stir hand nor think in mid heart,
And though he strew the grave with gold,
His born brothers, their buried bodies
Be an unlikely treasure hoard.",,,GPT-4o,古文学,英文,"The passage is a reflective monologue of a seafarer who recounts his hardships and solitary life at sea.

"May I for my own self song’s truth reckon,
Journey’s jargon, how I in harsh days
Hardship endured oft.
Bitter breast-cares have I abided,
Known on my keel many a care’s hold,
And dire sea-surge, and there I oft spent

"THESEUS.
Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
Another moon; but oh, methinks, how slow
This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires,
Like to a step-dame or a dowager,
Long withering out a young man’s revenue.
HIPPOLYTA.
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
And then the moon, like to a silver bow
New bent in heaven, shall behold the night
Of our solemnities.
THESEUS.
Go, Philostrate,
Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
Turn melancholy forth to funerals;
The pale companion is not for our pomp.
[Exit Philostrate.]
Hippolyta, I woo’d thee with my sword,
And won thy love doing thee injuries;
But I will wed thee in another key,
With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.
Enter Egeus, Hermia, Lysander and Demetrius.
EGEUS.
Happy be Theseus, our renownèd Duke!
THESEUS.
Thanks, good Egeus. What’s the news with thee?
EGEUS.
Full of vexation come I, with complaint
Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
This man hath my consent to marry her.
Stand forth, Lysander. And, my gracious Duke,
This man hath bewitch’d the bosom of my child.
Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
And interchang’d love-tokens with my child.
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
With feigning voice, verses of feigning love;
And stol’n the impression of her fantasy
With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits,
Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats (messengers
Of strong prevailment in unharden’d youth)
With cunning hast thou filch’d my daughter’s heart,
Turn’d her obedience (which is due to me)
To stubborn harshness. And, my gracious Duke,
Be it so she will not here before your grace
Consent to marry with Demetrius,
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens:
As she is mine I may dispose of her;
Which shall be either to this gentleman
Or to her death, according to our law
Immediately provided in that case.
THESEUS.
What say you, Hermia? Be advis’d, fair maid.
To you your father should be as a god;
One that compos’d your beauties, yea, and one
To whom you are but as a form in wax
By him imprinted, and within his power
To leave the figure, or disfigure it.
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
HERMIA.
So is Lysander.
THESEUS.
In himself he is.
But in this kind, wanting your father’s voice,
The other must be held the worthier.
HERMIA.
I would my father look’d but with my eyes.
THESEUS.
Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
HERMIA.
I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.
I know not by what power I am made bold,
Nor how it may concern my modesty
In such a presence here to plead my thoughts:
But I beseech your Grace that I may know
The worst that may befall me in this case,
If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
THESEUS.
Either to die the death, or to abjure
For ever the society of men.
Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,
Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
Whether, if you yield not to your father’s choice,
You can endure the livery of a nun,
For aye to be in shady cloister mew’d,
To live a barren sister all your life,
Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
Thrice-blessèd they that master so their blood
To undergo such maiden pilgrimage,
But earthlier happy is the rose distill’d
Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn,
Grows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness.","Hēr cwiðeþ Seos, se Eorl Atena, ymbe his gewritod wæfersyns mid Hippolyta, cwæðende þæt dagas sindon langlice oþ tēon niwran tymes.

"Now begin;
For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs
Close by the ground, to hear our conference.
URSULA.
The pleasant’st angling is to see the fish
Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,
And greedily devour the treacherous bait:
So angle we for Beatrice; who even now
Is couched in the woodbine coverture.
Fear you not my part of the dialogue.
HERO.
Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing
Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.
[They advance to the bower.]
No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;
I know her spirits are as coy and wild
As haggards of the rock.
URSULA.
But are you sure
That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?
HERO.
So says the Prince, and my new-trothed lord.
URSULA.
And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?
HERO.
They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;
But I persuaded them, if they lov’d Benedick,
To wish him wrestle with affection,
And never to let Beatrice know of it.
URSULA.
Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman
Deserve as full as fortunate a bed
As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?
HERO.
O god of love! I know he doth deserve
As much as may be yielded to a man;
But Nature never fram’d a woman’s heart
Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
Misprising what they look on, and her wit
Values itself so highly, that to her
All matter else seems weak. She cannot love,
Nor take no shape nor project of affection,
She is so self-endear’d.
URSULA.
Sure I think so;
And therefore certainly it were not good
She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.
HERO.
Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,
How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featur’d,
But she would spell him backward: if fair-fac’d,
She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;
If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antick,
Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;
If low, an agate very vilely cut;
If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
If silent, why, a block moved with none.
So turns she every man the wrong side out,
And never gives to truth and virtue that
Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.
URSULA.
Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.
HERO.
No; not to be so odd, and from all fashions,
As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable.
But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,
She would mock me into air: O! she would laugh me
Out of myself, press me to death with wit.
Therefore let Benedick, like cover’d fire,
Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:
It were a better death than die with mocks,
Which is as bad as die with tickling.
URSULA.
Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.

No; rather I will go to Benedick,
And counsel him to fight against his passion.

"BAPTISTA.
Gentlemen, importune me no farther,
For how I firmly am resolv’d you know;
That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter
Before I have a husband for the elder.
If either of you both love Katherina,
Because I know you well and love you well,
Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.
GREMIO.
To cart her rather: she’s too rough for me.
There, there, Hortensio, will you any wife?
KATHERINA.
[To Baptista] I pray you, sir, is it your will
To make a stale of me amongst these mates?
HORTENSIO.
Mates, maid! How mean you that? No mates for you,
Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.
KATHERINA.
I’ faith, sir, you shall never need to fear;
I wis it is not half way to her heart;
But if it were, doubt not her care should be
To comb your noddle with a three-legg’d stool,
And paint your face, and use you like a fool.

From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!

And me, too, good Lord!

"When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye
the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.
For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not
always.
For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did
it for my burial.
Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.

Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,

And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.

And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.

Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the
disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that
we prepare for thee to eat the passover?
And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him,
The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover
at thy house with my disciples.
And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.

40:026:020 Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.

And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one
of you shall betray me.
And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them
to say unto him, Lord, is it I?
And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in
the dish, the same shall betray me.
The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.

Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.

And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.

And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,
saying, Drink ye all of it;
For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for
many for the remission of sins.
But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.

And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.

Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.

But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.

Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be
offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.
Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night,
before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I
not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.
Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.

And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and
began to be sorrowful and very heavy.
Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even
unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.
And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.

And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and
saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?
Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit
indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.

And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were
heavy.
And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third
time, saying the same words.
Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.

And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.

Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever
I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.
And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and
kissed him.
And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then
came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.
And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out
his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high
priest's, and smote off his ear.
Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his
place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the
sword.
Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he
shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?
But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?
In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.

But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.","Þa wæs on þam dagum, þæt Jesu cwealde to þære wīfan, þe hine gesmyrede mid deorwurðre sealf, 'Þēos dǽd is for minum bebyrgenne gearuwe gedōn, and þæt beoð on eallum middanearde forðȳdlīce fægnunge, þær þæt godspell gebodod biþ.

"When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye
the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.
For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not
always.
For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did
it for my burial.
Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.

Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,

And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.

And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.

Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the
disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that
we prepare for thee to eat the passover?
And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him,
The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover
at thy house with my disciples.
And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.

40:026:021 Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.

And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one
of you shall betray me.
And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them
to say unto him, Lord, is it I?
And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in
the dish, the same shall betray me.
The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.

Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.

And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.

And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,
saying, Drink ye all of it;
For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for
many for the remission of sins.
But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.

And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.

Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.

But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.

Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be
offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.

"现在赶上了三代圣王已经不在的时代，天下的仁义已经丧失殆尽，后世的君子，有的认为厚葬久丧就是仁，就是义，是孝子理所当然要做的事；也有的认为厚葬久丧为不仁，为不义，不是孝子应该做的事。这两种人，在言论上相互否定，在行为上也截然相反，可是大家都说：“我们是继承尧、舜，禹、汤、、武王的大道。”但是他们的相互否定，行为相反，于是后世的君子对这两种说法都感到疑惑。如果对这两种不同意见感到疑惑，那么姑且转而对国家百姓进行施政的情况进行考察吧。看看厚葬久丧，在哪一方面能符合上述三种利益？假使仿照他们的说法，采用他们的主张，实行厚葬久丧确实可以使贫者富、寡者众，可以使危者安、乱者治，这就是仁的、义的，这也是孝子应该做的事，真心为别人打算的人，就不能不努力去做。仁者把厚葬久丧的办法在天下推广，作为制度，还要使百姓赞誉它，永远坚持不改变。假使采用他们的说法，实行他们的办法，厚葬久丧确实不可以使贫者富、寡者众，不可以使危者安、乱者治！这就是不仁的、不义的，这不是孝子应做的事。真心为别人打算的人，就不能不劝阻别人这样做。仁者将在天下除掉它，不准采用，让大家一起来反对这种做法，永远不用这个做法。所以说兴天下之利，除天下之害，而使国家百姓得不到治理的，从古至今还不曾有过。
从何知道是这样呢？现在天下的士君子们，对于厚葬久丧的是非利害，大多持疑惑不定的态度。所以墨子说道：“既然如此，那么我们姑且来考察一下坚持厚葬久丧主张的人的言论，用来治理国家。”在王公大人有丧事的时候，就说棺木一定要厚，必须埋葬在深深的地下，装殓的衣服被褥必须多而又多，随葬的文绣必须繁富，坟墓必须高大；一般平民百姓遇到丧事时，几乎要竭尽全家所有资财；诸侯遇到丧事，府库为之空虚，然后将金玉珠宝装饰在死者身上，用丝絮组带束住，并把车马埋藏在圹穴中，又必定要多多制造帷幕帐幔、钟鼎、鼓、几筵、酒壶、镜子、戈、剑、羽旄、象牙、皮革，置于死者寝宫而埋掉，然后才满意。至于殉葬，天子、诸侯死后所杀的殉葬者，多的数百人，少的数十人；将军、大夫死后所杀的殉葬者，多的数十人，少的数人。",在探讨古代丧葬习俗中厚葬久丧的问题时，人们常常提及这一习俗与仁义孝道之间的紧密联系。然而，后世的君子们对于厚葬久丧的看法存在显著的分歧。一方面，有人认为这种做法能够体现对逝者的尊重和对生者的教化，另一方面，也有观点质疑这种习俗是否真正符合社会整体的利益。本文将借用墨子的观点，对厚葬久丧的合理性进行探讨，并结合实际操作中的奢靡之风和社会资源耗费问题，分析其对国家和百姓的影响，提出兴天下之利，除天下之害的主张。 墨子主张效益最大化，认为如果某项行为可以带来实质性的社会利益，那么这种行为就是值得推行的。如果厚葬久丧能够使贫者富、寡者众、危者安、乱者治，那么这种行为自然应当被视为仁义的表现，并予以大力推行。反之，如果这种做法不仅无法带来上述利益，反而浪费社会资源，增加百姓负担，那么厚葬久丧就是不仁不义的表现，应当及时禁止。 厚葬久丧在实际操作中往往表现出奢靡之风。为了显示对亡者的哀悼和尊敬，很多家庭会不惜重金，购置豪华棺椁，建造高档墓穴，甚至举行长时间的守灵和祭祀仪式。这不仅加重了家庭的经济负担，还导致社会资源的极大浪费。国家在此过程中也需要付出大量的物资和人力，影响了其他公共事务的推进。 随着社会的不断发展，厚葬久丧的习俗逐渐演变为一种攀比和炫耀的手段。人们在丧葬上的花费逐年增加，但却未必能带来社会风尚的改善或家庭幸福的提升。在这种情况下，我们需要重新审视厚葬久丧的价值和意义，寻找更加符合社会利益的丧葬方式。 墨子的观点为我们提供了一个理性的判断标准，即任何行为都应当以是否能够带来实际的社会利益为评判依据。农忙时节的劳动力被厚葬久丧所占用，影响农业生产和经济发展；大量的木材和其他建材被用于墓葬，导致资源浪费和生态破坏；家庭为厚葬久丧所消耗的财富，原本可以用于改善生活条件、提高教育和医疗水平。由此可见，厚葬久丧不仅未能带来预期的仁义之效，反而带来了种种不利影响。 因此，我们应当倡导简约而有意义的丧葬方式，既能表达对逝者的哀思，又不致于浪费社会资源。我们可以参考其他文化或国家采取的一些丧葬方式，比如骨灰安置、生态葬等，这些方式不仅经济实惠，还能更好地保护环境。 综上所述，厚葬久丧作为一种古老的丧葬习俗，虽然初衷是好的，但在实际操作中却往往偏离了仁义孝道的本意，带来了许多社会问题。我们应当秉持墨子的观点，以实际利益为导向，倡导兴天下之利，除天下之害，推动丧葬习俗的改革，寻找更多符合现代社会需求的做法，真正实现仁义孝道的目的，让社会更加和谐美好。,易,GPT-4o,哲学,中文,这段文字探讨了古代丧葬习俗中厚葬久丧的仁义孝道问题。文章指出，后世君子对厚葬久丧的看法存在分歧，并质疑厚葬久丧是否真能带来社会利益。作者借墨子的观点，认为如果厚葬久丧能使贫者富、寡者众、危者安、乱者治，那就是仁义的行为，应该推行；反之，如不能带来这些利益，就是不仁不义的做法，应当禁止。文中详细描述了厚葬久丧在实际操作中的奢靡之风和社会资源的耗费，认为这种做法对国家和百姓无益，倡导兴天下之利，除天下之害。,866

"肩吾问连叔：“我听接舆说话，宏大而不着边际，说到哪里是哪里，我惊叹他的言论，好像天上银河一样漫无边际。与常理大不相符，实在是不近人情啊。”

连叔问：“他说些什么？”肩吾说：“他说：‘在藐姑射那座山上住着神仙，肌肤像雪一样白，姿态婉媚如同处子，不吃五谷杂粮，终日吸风饮露，乘着云气驾驭飞龙，遨游于四海之外，他的神情专一，能使农作物不受病害而五谷丰登。’我认为他所说的话虚妄不可信。”

连叔说：“不错，盲人无法看到纹理的美观，聋人无法听到钟鼓的声音。难道只有形体上才有盲、聋这一类的缺陷吗？其实人的心智也是一样的。他指的是你这位神人，他的等待与万物混同在一起。世人祈求他来治理天下，谁肯劳心劳力把治理天下当回事呢！他这样的人，外物无法伤害到他，洪水滔天也淹不死他，天气旱热到即使把金属与石头都晒化了，土壤、山林都烤焦了，他也不觉得热。他用尘垢秕糠，也能铸造出尧舜来，谁又肯把世务当回事呢！宋国人到越国去贩卖帽子，而越国人断发文身，帽子对他们来说是无用之物。尧治理天下的百姓，掌控海内的政局，于是到汾水北边的藐姑射山上去见四位高人，怅然间忘记了自己的天下。",肩吾与连叔的对话触及了人类理解的局限。肩吾讲述了接舆所说的神仙故事，但他对这些超脱于世俗的言论持怀疑态度。肩吾的怀疑反映了人类心智的局限，有些真理超越了我们通常的理解能力。连叔用聋盲者的例子来说明这个道理：聋者不能感受声音，盲者不能感知美景，同样在心智上也有人因局限而无法理解更深奥的道理。这种局限不是身体上的，而是心灵和认知上的隔阂。接舆所言的神仙之道，超脱于世俗之外，与世间万物浑然一体，使得我们普通人难以揣摩和理解。连叔还提到，世人通常遵循常规去做事，如同宋国人把不适用的帽子卖给越国人，越人根本用不到。因此，普通人往往是迷茫的，无法察觉真正深奥的理。举尧治天下的例子，尧见高人却忘却了天下治理的重任，暗示了追求深奥之理可能会让人脱离现实事务。真正的智慧可能存在于我们无法触及的高度，我们常常被日常事务所束缚，难以参透更高层次的道理。这段对话揭示了一个深刻的哲学问题：人类的认知有其边界，某些真理超越了我们能够理解和感知的范围。要达到这种境界，或许需要某种超越普通经验的智慧和心灵修行。,易,GPT-4o,哲学,中文,这段文字讲述了肩吾与连叔的对话。肩吾描述了接舆所说的神仙故事，以及他自己对这种话语的不信任。连叔则指出，像聋盲的人不能感知声音和美，心智上也有人因局限而无法理解更深奥的道理。接舆所言的神仙超脱于世俗之外，与世间万物混同，人无法理解。连叔还提到，世人守常做事，如宋国贩帽于越国，而越人用不到帽子，尧治天下见高人却忘却天下。这意指真正深奥之理一般人难以尽解。,477

如果各人都拿自己的意见作为衡量的标准，那么谁会没有自己的标准？难道只有智者才有吗？事实上愚者也有啊！如果在没有形成主见之前就乱分是非，这跟今天去越国而昨天到了一样不可能。这就是以无标准作为标准，若以无标准作为标准，即使神圣的大禹也不知道该怎么办，我又有什么办法呢？","在我们日常生活的海洋中，智识差异似乎无处不在，穿插在每一个人与人的交往中。人类的智慧有大小之分，小智慧之人常常为了一己之利斤斤计较，他们为微不足道的小事愤愤不平。而那些拥有大智慧之人则能泰然自若，面对纷繁复杂的世界，他们似乎能以更广阔的视角审视一切，从容应对各种挑战和难题。这种智识上的差异不仅在思维方式中体现，更影响了人们在不同情境下的情绪反应及行为表现。

情绪是人类生命体验中不可或缺的一部分。人在不同的情境下，会产生各种各样的情绪，这些情绪带来了多样的行为反应。比如，当我们面对恐惧时，往往会表现出逃避的行为，而当我们陷入愤怒时，可能会采取对抗的方式。在这种过程中，情绪影响着我们的决策，塑造了我们的人生成长路径。真正的大智慧者，能够意识到情绪的力量并加以调节，从而在生活中表现出更加成熟和明智的行为。

不仅人与人之间需要考量智识上的差异，人与自然、人与自身以及人与主宰者的关系更值得我们深入探究。人生在世，我们难免在不同阶段面对种种迷茫和困惑。人类常常为生活中的追逐和竞争感到疲惫，内心深处却又不甘心停止这场无休止的追逐。或许，人类的本性中就蕴藏着一种对更高智慧和更高境界的渴望，这种渴望推动着我们不断前行，也让我们在竞争和追逐中迷失自我。

至此，我们不禁要反思，人生的最终归宿究竟是何处？面对不断变化的世界和内心的种种波动，我们究竟应该如何找到自己的方向？对于这些问题，不同的人会有不同的解答。智者和愚者基于各自的智识和经验，会用不同的标准进行判断。然而，如果我们在没有形成坚定的主见之前就草率地进行判断，往往会让自己陷入更深的困惑之中。因此，怀疑与反思是无比重要的，它们帮助我们在复杂的人生旅途中更好地认识自己，从而找到真正属于自己的答案。

怀疑是思想进步的起点，没有怀疑，便没有真理的发现。通过对自身、对世界以及对所谓主宰者的怀疑和反思，我们能够逐步建立起自己的智慧体系。自我主宰是一个值得探讨的话题，它不仅仅是对自身行为的掌控，更是对内心世界的深刻理解。能够主宰自我的人，往往是那些经过不断探索和思考，最终找到内心宁静的人。

哲学的意义就在于它引导我们去探讨这些深刻的问题，让我们在茫茫人生中找到自己的位置。通过对智识差异、情绪反应、人与自然、人与自身以及人与主宰者之间关系的深入思考，我们不仅能够更好地了解自己，还能够在人生的旅途中走得更远、更稳健。",易,GPT-4o,哲学,中文,该段文字探讨了人与人之间的智识差异及其表现，指出小智慧之人多斤斤计较，而大智慧之人则能泰然自若。它还描述了在不同情境下人们的各种情绪反应，以及这些情绪如何影响其行为。接着，作者讨论了人与自然、人自身以及主宰者之间的关系，表达了对人生中不断追逐、竞争、迷茫以及最终归宿的反思。最后，作者指出即便智者和愚者都有各自的判断标准，但是在没有形成主见之前进行判断是毫无意义的，提出怀疑人与自我主宰的可能性与价值。,874

徐无鬼说：“天地对万物的养育是均等的，地位高的人不能够自认为高人一等，地位低的人也不应认为自己矮人三分。你身为大国的国君，用全国百姓的劳累困苦换来自己眼耳口鼻的享用，弄得心神不自得。圣明之人从不为自己的私欲求取分外的东西，人的心灵天然喜欢和顺而厌恶偏私，偏私是一种严重的病态，所以，我特地前来慰问你。只有你患有这种病症，这是为什么呢？”武候说：“我想见先生已经很久了。如果我爱民为义而制止战争，这样做行了吧？”徐无鬼说：“不行。所谓爱民，其实是害民的开始；为义而制止战争，也是制造新的战争的根源。如果你从这些方面来治理国家，恐怕不会成功。凡是成就了美好的名声，也就有了作恶的工具。虽然你这样做是在推行正义，相反更接近于虚假啊！出现仁义形迹肯定会出现伪造仁义的形迹，成功了肯定会自夸，出现了变故必定会再次掀起战争。你千万不要在城门瞭望台下摆兵，作严阵以待状；不要在宫里陈列步卒骑士；不要包藏一颗贪求之心；不要用智巧去取胜，不要用策略去制敌；不要去通过战争去征服别人。通过杀死别国的士卒和百姓，吞并别国的土地，用来满足自己的私欲，这样战争究竟有何益处？胜利又存在于哪里？你还是停止争战，修养天性，顺应自然赋予你的真情，而不去扰乱其规律。这样，百姓就能够摆脱死亡的威胁，你哪里用得上息兵的议论？”,"徐无鬼的劝说向我们展现了深刻的哲学智慧。他谆谆告诫武候，不应高高在上，更不应利用百姓的痛苦来满足个人的私欲。这种做法，不仅违背了道德伦理，更完全忽视了治理国家的真正目的。徐无鬼认为，一个真正明智的统治者，应是将人民的幸福作为首要目标，而不是通过战争或策略来强制征服他国。他的观点揭示了权力与道德间的冲突，以及如何在这二者间找到平衡的必要性。

我们可以从徐无鬼的劝说中，看到他对人类行为与自然法则之间关系的深刻理解。爱民与制止战争的初衷或许是善意的，但其背后的执行往往未必能实现预期效果。徐无鬼明确指出，过度的干预和试图通过人为手段改变局势，可能会引发更大的混乱与破坏。而这种混乱和破坏，终究会回到百姓身上，带给他们无尽的痛苦与折磨。

徐无鬼提倡顺应自然的规律，这种观点与道家思想相契合，即主张'无为而治，以静制动'。他认为治理国家应避免过多的干预与控制，尊重自然界和社会发展的固有规律。在他看來，人类的智慧虽然高超，但终究无法抵抗自然的力量。试图用战争或策略征服他国，只会带来短暂的辉煌与长久的不安。只有在顺应自然的基础上，百姓才能真正摆脱死亡的威胁，获得持久的和平与稳定。

这样的一种哲学思想提醒着我们，每一位社会的参与者，无论是统治者还是普通百姓，都应时刻反思自己的行为是否与自然规律相符。我们的权力和智慧，不应用来增加他人的痛苦，而应致力于增进所有人的幸福。通过顺应自然的规律，我们不仅能避免无意义的斗争，也能真正建立一个和谐共处的美好社会。这不仅是徐无鬼的劝说对武候的教诲，更是对我们每一个人的智慧启迪。",易,GPT-4o,哲学,中文,徐无鬼劝说武候不要高高在上，并批评他用百姓的痛苦来满足自己私欲的做法。他认为爱民和制止战争并不能真正解决问题，反而可能引发更大的混乱。徐无鬼提倡顺应自然的规律，不去通过战争和策略来征服他国，这样百姓才能真正摆脱死亡的威胁。,545

"孔子去见老子，老子刚洗了头，正披散着头发晾干，那木然的样子，简直不像是一个活着的人。孔子躲在一个地方耐心地等待着，过了一会儿，二人会面，孔子说：“是我眼花，还是真的呢？刚才先生的身体，挺立着一动不动的样子简直就像是一段干木头似的，那全神贯注的样子，好像是把天地万物都忘得一干二净，只剩下了您所思考的问题。”

老聃说：“我在天地万物的起源问题神游，进入了深沌虚无的境界。”

老聃说：“心里对这个问题感到十分的困惑，发现它不是人所能理解的，嘴张开想说点什么，却不知道从何说起。试着给你谈一下它的大略吧！地之极致为阴冷之气，天之极致是炎热之气，阴冷之气虽在地上却植根于天上，炎热之气虽在天上却植根于地上，两者相互交流贯通和合，这就生成了万物，或许有某个统领这一切的纲纪存在，但我们却看不到它的形体。消亡又生息，盈满又空虚，一暗一明，日变月化，每时每刻都有所作为，我们却不知道它是怎么样起作用的。万物的出生应该有一个萌发的地方，亏物死亡也应该有一个归宿，开始和终结是相反的，我们却不知道它们的开端在哪里，也不知道它们结束在什么地方。可是如果没有这样的事物存在，那么这个世界该是由谁来作为它的主宰呢？”

老聃说：“食草的兽类，不担忧更换沼泽地；水生的虫类，不担忧变换水是在什么地方。因为那都是些小的变化而并没有失去基本的生活条件，所以，喜怒哀乐的心情就不会随着小的变化而在心中引起激荡。天下这块地方，是万物共同生息的场所。既然万事万物都有着共同的生存背景，那么我们的四肢百体即便早晚将成为一堆垃圾，由于生和死、终和始也将和昼夜交替一样地循环不止，谁也无法打乱这一循环性的自然秩序，我们也就不和对它太介意。如果连生死都能不介意，何况人生那一点得和失、祸和福之间的斤斤计较呢！所有隶属于自己的身外之物都和得失祸福连在一起，所以对于它们，完全可以像丢弃泥土一样弃之不顾，因为我们懂得我们的身体比那些隶属于此身的东西要更加珍贵些。如果懂得了自身存在的珍贵，也就不会为一些小的变故而患失了。而且世界的千变万化是无穷无尽的，又何必这么一个无限性的问题而弄得自己心神不宁呢！已经明白了大道的这种属性的人是可以对这个问题释怀的。”

孔子说：“先生对天地万物已以有了如此高明的理解，而且还借助最准确的言说来提高自己的修养和心理素质。古来的君子，谁又能超过您呢！”

老聃说：“话不能这样说。水的清明澄澈，是在无所作为的情况下才会如此；最高境界的人的德行，并不是修养得来的，因为万事万物事实上根本无法也不可能离开道的范围。就像天自然就高，地自然就厚，日月自然就明亮一样，哪里需要像我这般来修养啊！”

孔子出来，把这些告诉了颜回，他说：“我对于道的认识，就如同醋坛中的飞虫一样，太渺小了！如果没有先生启发我，抹掉我蒙蔽在心头的糊涂想法，我就不会知道天地全备的道理！”",在古老的东方，有两位伟大的哲人，他们的名字在千年之后仍为人所传颂。一次机缘，孔子拜访了老子，这次会面永远改变了孔子的哲学观与人生观。孔子踏入老子的居所，就像进入了一片宁静的湖泊。这个地方并没有华丽的装饰，反而显得简单而自然而然。孔子见到老子时，老子正在深思天地万物的起源问题，整个氛围被一种深沌虚无的境界包围。孔子不禁心生敬畏和好奇，想要了解老子对这些问题的看法，因而向老子请教万物的生成和消亡之理。\n\n老子并不急于回答。他静静地看着孔子，仿佛要通过表象直达孔子的内心。经过一段短暂而又永恒的沉默，老子开口道：“天地初始，本是虚无。万物从无中生，又归于无。生与死、得与失、祸与福，皆为循环往复之理，这其中隐藏的是自然的无为。”老子的声音像是一道轻柔的溪流，缓缓地流进孔子的心田。\n\n孔子听到这里，感到一股不可名状的力量，他似乎开始理解老子所描述的境界。老子继续说道：“人若能参透这生死轮回的奥秘，便能达到心境平和的最高境界。你看那些花草树木，它们生长、开花、凋零，都是遵循自然的规律，而不为生死所扰。不为得失所动，不为祸福所扰，方能真正的心境平和。”\n\n这时，孔子心里顿悟：所谓修养，并不是刻意为之，而是顺应自然。老子的智慧和德行，正是自然无为的结果，而不是通过外在的努力和刻意的行为而得来。孔子深感自己的理解过于渺小，与老子的洞察相比，无异于井底之蛙。孔子感激地向老子行礼，说道：“多谢先生的教诲，我今天才明白，原来道的精髓在于无为，而不是苦苦追寻。”\n\n老子微微一笑，注视着远方的天空，那里白云悠悠，仿佛在诉说着天地间的无尽奥秘。他收回目光，看着孔子，轻声道：“道在天地之中，亦在人心之内。一切看似简单，却蕴含着无穷的智慧。”孔子听罢，心中无尽的疑惑和困扰似乎消散了些许，他再次向老子表示感谢，并表示将会继续追求对道的理解，努力在自己的学说和行为中贯彻这一理想。\n\n于是，孔子离开了老子的居所，带着满腔的感激与新的思考。他开始更加关注自然与人性的和谐，不再执着于外在的修为，而是内心的平和与自然的契合。孔子的弟子们发现他们的老师变得更加从容和智慧，他的言行中充满了深远的智慧和淡然的气度，这源于他从老子处获得的启发。\n\n通过这次与老子的对话，孔子的思想发生了深刻的变化。他对道的理解更加深刻，认识到自然无为的重要性，更加重视内心的宁静与平和。老子则继续在他的虚无之境中追寻着更深的真理，两位哲人在各自的道路上不断探索，影响了无数后来的学者与思想家。\n\n千年之后，我们回顾这段对话，依然能够感受到其中深邃的智慧与哲理。生与死、得与失、祸与福，这一切都是生命的自然循环。真正的智慧与德行，并非来源于刻意的修养，而是源自对自然和内心的顺应。正如老子所言，“道在天地之中，亦在人心之内，一切看似简单，却蕴含着无穷的智慧。”这段对话不仅对孔子一生产生了深远的影响，也为后世传递了重要的哲学思想，为我们提供了思考人生的重要启示。\n,易,GPT-4o,哲学,中文,孔子拜访老子，见到老子在深思天地万物的起源问题，并感受到一种进入深沌虚无的境界。老子解释了万物生成、消亡的自然循环以及如何达到心境平和的最高境界，即不为生死、得失、祸福所扰。老子认为真正的智慧和德行是自然无为的结果，而不是刻意修养而来。孔子听后深有感触，认为自己对道的理解过于渺小，感激老子的启发。,1318
"孔子去见老子，老子刚洗了头，正披散着头发晾干，那木然的样子，简直不像是一个活着的人。孔子躲在一个地方耐心地等待着，过了一会儿，二人会面，孔子说：“是我眼花，还是真的呢？刚才先生的身体，挺立着一动不动的样子简直就像是一段干木头似的，那全神贯注的样子，好像是把天地万物都忘得一干二净，只剩下了您所思考的问题。”

"孟子说：“君子和一般人不同的地方，就在于居心不同。君子心里老惦记着仁，老惦记着礼。仁人爱他人，有礼的人尊敬他人。爱他人的人，别人总是爱他；尊敬他人的人，别人总是尊敬他。假如这里有个人，他对待我蛮横无礼，那君子一定反躬自问：我一定不够仁，一定不够有礼，不然，这种态度怎么会来呢？反躬自问后仍然觉得，我实在仁，实在有礼，那人的蛮横无礼还是原样，君子一定又反躬自问：我一定不够忠心。反躬自问后仍然觉得，我实在忠心耿耿，那人的蛮横无礼还是原样，君子就会说：‘这不过是个妄人罢了，这样不讲理，那和禽兽有什么区别呢？对于禽兽又有什么好责备的呢？’

“所以君子有长期的忧患，却没有突发的忧患。但是，下面这样的忧虑是有的：舜是人，我也是人。舜为天下人所效法，能流芳百世，我却仍然不免是个普通人。这个才是值得忧虑的事。有了忧虑怎么办呢？尽力向舜学习罢了。至于君子的别的忧患，可是没有的。不是仁义的事不干，不合礼节的事不做。即使有突发的忧患，君子也不以为痛苦了。”","孟子在《孟子·梁惠王》一书中，阐述了君子与一般人之间的根本区别在于内心是否长存仁义与礼仪。君子不仅在行为上表现出对他人的关怀与尊重，更在内心深处永远怀有仁爱之心和恭敬之意。因此，君子能够获得他人的爱戴与尊敬，这不仅是因为他们的外在行为，更是因为内心深处的道德光辉昭示于外。反之，普通人则可能缺乏这样的内在修养，容易被外界的诱惑干扰，导致行为失礼，内心缺乏真正的仁义与礼仪。

当君子遇到他人的无礼之举时，首先会进行自我反思，检查自身是否在言行方面存在不仁不义或不忠不诚的地方。他们不会急于责备对方，而是审视自己，力求在内心得到提升与净化。通过这种内省的过程，君子最终会明白，很多时候的确只是对方的无礼无理，而非自己的过失。因此，君子以宽容的心态对待他人，不会轻易责难，反而更加谨慎地提升自己的道德修为。

对君子而言，真正的长期忧虑并不在于外界的无理对待或突如其来的变故，而在于自身是否不断进步，持续提升自我修养，以追求成为像舜那样的圣贤。孟子以舜为代表的圣人作为君子的榜样，倡导君子应时刻保持内心的清明和高尚的道德目标。君子在追求道德圆满的道路上，不会因一时的得失或外界的干扰而感到痛苦，他们的内心安定而坚定，致力于长期的自我提升，追求更加理想的人格境界。",易,GPT-4o,哲学,中文,孟子认为君子和一般人的区别在于内心是否长存仁义与礼仪。君子总是爱人尊人，因此别人也会爱他和尊敬他。遇到别人无礼时，君子会反思自身是否不够仁义或忠心，最终发现只是对方无理，不必责备。君子有长期的忧虑在于自我提升，追求成为像舜那样的圣人，而不会为突发事件感到痛苦。,424

首先，家庭和雇佣关系中的矛盾往往源于彼此的期待。家庭成员之间，由于生活在同一屋檐下，往往对彼此有更高的期望，这种期望有时候会演变成压力和冲突。夫妻之间的关系尤为复杂，如齐桓公因家庭矛盾而欲讨伐蔡国的事件。夫妻一方在期待中未能满足对方的希望，可能会造成情感上的疏离，甚至引发政治上的行动。在这个例子中，齐桓公因夫妻矛盾萌生纷争之心，但管仲的劝止则提醒我们理智和智慧在处理家庭和权力之间关系的重要性。

此外，历史上不乏个人与其士兵的关系引发矛盾的例子。吴起是个典型的案例，他对待士兵的爱护可堪称典范，但这种爱护却引发了士兵母亲的担忧。士兵的母亲，即使看到吴起的宽仁，仍然担忧儿子在战争中的安全。这种矛盾反映了亲情与职责之间的张力。这种张力在现代社会中依旧存在，往往需要找到一个平衡点，使得家庭的关怀与职业的责任能够和谐美满。吴起的故事提醒了我们，个人与他的社会职责关系如何影响彼此的情感，并在更大的权力结构中起到不可忽视的作用。

权力的彰显和征服往往成为历史发展的重要驱动力。赵武灵王和秦昭襄王分别通过征服和刻字来展示自己的权威。这种彰显不仅是政治上的需要，更是个人权力渴望的体现。在许多历史事件中，权力的竞争和征服不仅局限于国家层面，也在家庭、社会等各个层面反复出现。权力是一把双刃剑，它可以带来秩序和繁荣，也可以引发战争和混乱。权力的使用，既需要智慧和仁慈，也需要策略和决断。

在复杂的历史背景下，策略和情感的交织催生了一个又一个历史经典。晋文公返回晋国后对子犯表示感激与合作，展现了情感在权力中的重要性。权力不仅仅是冷冰冰的控制手段，更是需要通过情感、信任等软性关系来维系和运作。晋文公与子犯之间的合作不仅奠定了晋国的稳定，更为后世提供了权力与情感深度互动的范例。

整个历史事件中，情感和策略的作用是紧密相连的。齐桓公、吴起、赵武灵王、秦昭襄王和晋文公的事例，通过家族矛盾、征兵策略、权力展示和感恩合作，展示了权力、情感和策略之间的深刻关联。这些关系不但影响了历史事件的进程，也影响了参与者的个人命运。

在现代社会中，人际关系和历史事件中的情感和策略依然具有指导意义。我们仍需从历史中汲取智慧，用理智和智慧处理家庭、工作和社会中的各种关系。要理解每个人的期待，并通过沟通和合作化解矛盾，才能建设和谐和稳定的社会环境。

综上所述，家庭和社会中的期望、矛盾、权力、情感与策略在历史中相互交织，形成了丰富的人际关系网络。这些元素共同塑造了历史，影响了无数个人的命运。通过对历史事件的理解，我们不仅能更好地把握当下，还能为未来的人际关系提供宝贵的经验和启示。",易,GPT-4o,哲学,中文,这段文字描述了人与人之间的关系以及几个历史事件。首先，讨论了家庭和雇佣关系中因彼此期待而产生的矛盾。接着，讲述了几个历史事件：文公攻打宋国和越国攻打吴国，齐桓公因夫妻矛盾欲讨伐蔡国，但被管仲劝止；吴起爱护士兵却引发士兵母亲的担忧；赵武灵王和秦昭襄王通过征服和刻字来彰显权威；晋文公返回晋国后对子犯表示感激与合作。这些故事展示了权力、情感和策略在历史中的作用。,1435

"人在小孩的时候，父母抚养他很马虎，孩子长大以后要埋怨父母；孩子壮年时期，供养父母微薄，父母就恼怒责备他。儿子和父母是血肉至亲，但有时责骂有时埋怨，都是因为各自怀着相互依赖的心理而认为对方不能周到地照顾自己。雇用雇工来播种耕耘，主人花费家财准备好的饮食，挑选布币交换钱币来付报酬，不是喜欢雇工，而是说：像这样做，雇工耕地将会深耕，锄草才会精细。雇工尽力而快速地耕田耕地，使尽技巧整理畦埂，不是因为喜爱主人，而是说：像这样做，饭菜才会丰盛，钱币将会容易得到。主人这样供养雇工而爱惜功力，有父亲和儿子之间的惠泽，而雇工专心一意地为主人工作，都是怀着为自己打算的心理。所以人们办事和给人好处，如果从对自己有利着想，那么关系疏远的人也容易和好；从对自己有害处着想，那么父子之间也要分离而且埋怨。

文公攻打宋国，便先发表言论说：“我听说宋国的君主昏庸无道，蔑视侮辱年老有德之人，分配财物不公平，发布法令不守信用，我来为宋国的百姓除掉他。”

越国攻打吴国，便先发表言论说：“我听说吴王夫差修筑了一座如皇台，挖掘了很深的护城河，使老百姓疲劳困苦，榨干了老百姓的钱财，而且耗尽老百姓的力量，我来替老百姓惩罚他。”

蔡侯的女儿嫁给齐桓公做妻子，齐桓公同她一块儿乘船，这位夫人晃动着船，齐桓公非常害怕，命令她停下来她却不听，齐桓公愤怒地休了她。随后又想召回她，蔡国已把她改嫁了。齐桓公非常恼怒，将要讨伐蔡国。管仲劝谏说：“因为夫妻之间的游戏，不值得去讨伐别人的国家，不能希望通过这个来建功立业，请不要计较这件事。”齐桓公不听从管仲的劝谏。管仲说：“一定不能打消这个念头，楚国给天子上贡的苞茅草已经三年不交了，您不如发兵为周天子讨伐楚国。楚国臣服了，趁机回兵袭击蔡国，说：‘我为周天子讨伐楚国，而蔡国却不派兵来听从调遣’，于是消灭它。这样做在名义上是正义的而实际上是有利的，所以一定要有替天子讨伐的名义，而后有报仇的实利。”

看见别人善的行为，一定会认为这个善行值得修养而把这善行自我保存起来。看见不善的行为，一定会心怀忧惧地自我反省。善的行为在自己身上，一定会坚定地自我爱好，不善的行为在自己身上，一定会认为是灾害而自己厌恶这些不善行为。所以，正当地指出我错误的人，是我的老师；正当地指出我对的人，是我的朋友；阿谀奉承我的人，是害我的盗贼。所以君子尊崇老师而亲近朋友，对盗贼则非常厌恶。爱好善良而不会满足，受到劝谏就能够警诫自己，即使想不进步，可能吗？小人则相反，自己非常混乱而厌恶别人指出自己的不对。自己非常无能而想别人说自己贤能。心意好像虎狼，行为好像禽兽，但又厌恶别人说自己是盗贼。亲近阿谀奉承的人，疏远诤谏的人，把修正自己的话视为讥笑，把最忠诚的人视为盗贼，即使想不灭亡，可能吗？诗经说：“乱吸取诋毁，实在很悲哀。谋划美好的，全都违背了，谋划不好的，则全都依从。”就是说这些小人。,如何对待他人的行为、意见，尤其是分辨善恶，是人类自我完善过程中必须面对的考验。君子之所以为君子，其根本在于他具备一种尊崇真理、爱慕贤德的品格。他们能够从指出自己错误的老师那里获取智慧，从指出自己正确的朋友那里获得激励，而对那些阿谀奉承的盗贼则充满厌恶。君子深知，惟有不断接受批评和劝谏，才能看清自身不足，进行自我反省和不断进步。对君子而言，全心全意追求内在的完善和外在的成就是其毕生的目标。他们明白，谬误和恶行一旦萌生，如果不及时加以纠正，势必会导致更大的混乱和灾难。而远离那些只会逢迎拍马之徒，既是维护自己心灵清明的必要举措，也是避免陷入混乱和弱化自我能力的关键所在。反观小人，他们由于自己心志不坚，目光短浅，往往厌恶指出自己不足的人，却钟爱那些阿谀奉承之徒。结果，他们在溺流于虚荣和欲望的泥潭中，逐渐失去自我，陷入混乱，最终沦为无能之辈，乃至自取灭亡。正因如此，接受批评与合理的劝谏不仅是自我完善的途径，更是维持个人与社会和谐的重要途径。在批评中锤炼自我，在真诚的讥诮中成长，这便是哲人发展的壮丽篇章。,易,GPT-4o,哲学,中文,这段文字讨论了如何对待他人的行为、意见和善恶之分。君子会尊崇指出自己错误的老师，亲近指出自己正确的朋友，厌恶阿谀奉承的盗贼，从而不断自我反省和进步。与此相对，小人则会厌恶指出自己不足的人，喜欢与阿谀奉承的人为伍，导致自身混乱和无能乃至灭亡。总结来说，这段论述强调了接受批评与劝谏以及远离阿谀奉承的重要性。,384

"孙子说：大凡兴兵十万，出征千里，百姓的耗费，国家的开支，每天至少耗资千金；国家内外动荡，民夫兵卒因往来奔波而疲惫不堪，不能安心从事耕作的人多达七十万家。这样相持多年就是为了争求有朝一日的胜利。如果最后却因吝惜爵禄和金钱，不肯用来重用间谍，以致不能掌握敌情而失败，那就是不仁到极点啊。这样的人不配做军队的统帅，不配做国君的辅臣，也不可能取得最后的胜利。英明的国君、贤能的将帅，之所以动辄就能战胜敌人，功业超越众人，就在于用兵作战之前便掌握了敌情。要事先了解敌情，决不能乞求鬼神的启示，也不能用相似的例子作类比推测，更不能从日月星辰运行的数理去验证，而只能从那些真正熟悉敌情的人那里去获取。

间谍的运用方式有“因间”“内间”“反间”“死间”“生间”五种。五种间谍一齐使用，使敌人无从捉摸我用间的规律，这就是使用间谍神妙莫测的方法，也正是国君克敌制胜的法宝。所谓“因间”，是利用敌国居民中的普通人做间谍；所谓“内间”，是指利用敌方的官员做我方的间谍；所谓“反间”，就是利用敌方派来的间谍，使之反过来为我效力；所谓“死间”，是指制造散布虚假情报，通过我方间谍将假情报传给敌间，诱使敌人上当。但事情一旦败露，这类间谍难免一死而被称为死间；所谓“生间”，是指能亲自活着回来报告敌情的间谍。

因此，对于统领三军、用兵打仗的国君和主将来说，三军之中没有比间谍更值得信赖的人了，军中的奖赏没有比奖赏间谍更优厚的了，军中的机密也没有比使用间谍更为机密的了。不是英明睿智的人不能任用间谍，不是仁义的人不能驱使间谍，不是谋虑精细的人不能分析判断间谍提供的情报真实性。微妙呀，微妙！在作战过程中无时无处不可以使用间谍。如果间谍工作还没有进行就泄露了用间的消息，那么，间谍和了解内情的人都要被处死。

凡是要攻打敌军，要攻占敌方城邑，要刺杀敌方某人，都必须预先了解敌方的守将、左右亲信、传达报告的官员、守门的官吏以及门客幕僚诸人的相关情报，而想要知道这一切就要指令我方间谍去侦察清楚。

对于敌人派来的刺探我方情报的敌方间谍，也必须把他们搜查出来，之后再用优厚的待遇和金钱来收买他们，对他们进行引诱开导，再放他们回去，这样就可以使他们成为反间，为我所用了。通过反间了解敌情，就能培植、利用因间和内间了；同样，根据反间提供的情报，就能让死间传播假情报给敌人了；由于从反间那里了解了敌情，避开了危险，生间也就可如期回报。这五种间谍的情况，君主都必须了解掌握，而了解情况的关键在于利用反间，所以对反间不可不给予优厚待遇。

以前，殷商的兴起，是因为商汤重用了在夏朝为臣、了解夏朝情况的伊尹；周朝的兴起，是由于周武王重用了了解商朝情况的姜子牙。因此，明智的君主，贤明的将帅，若能使用很有智谋的人做间谍，一定能取得极大的成功。这是用兵作战的关键，是军队行动的依靠。","《孙子兵法》作为军事战略的经典著作，其智慧不仅蜚声中外，而且在几千年的历史长河中依旧熠熠生辉。其中，孙子对间谍重要性的论述，无疑是其中极为关键的一部分。孙子通过详细分类和深刻分析，将间谍的运用提升至艺术的高度，这不仅体现了他对战争本质的深刻理解，也揭示了间谍在战争中的关键作用。本文将从五种间谍的分类及运用方式、间谍对战争的重要性以及古代历史实例等方面，详细探讨孙子对于间谍的独到见解与战略智慧。

首先，我们来细分一下孙子所提出的五种间谍：因间、内间、反间、死间和生间。每一种间谍都具有其独特的作用和适用场景。因间，是指利用敌国人民，特别是那些愿意卖国求荣的人士，为己方提供情报；内间，则是指收买敌方的官员或士兵，从内部获取机密；反间，是利用敌方派来的间谍，进行反间活动，使其为己所用；死间，是明知不可回归的间谍，是为了迷惑敌人而设下的祭坛；生间，即能平安返回并带回情报的间谍。

在这些分类中，每一种间谍都需要特殊的策略与技巧去培养和使用。比如，内间的培养需要慎重而相对隐秘的操作，需要极高的策反技巧。而反间的利用则更加复杂，需要识别敌方间谍，还要有反制的智慧。死间的作用更为直接，多是为了制造烟幕与假象，迷惑敌人。生间的运用中，信息的准确性与及时性都是其成功的关键。在实际操作中，这些间谍的运用往往是交叉进行的，通过多种间谍信息的互相验证和补充，可以达到最为真实和全面的情报获取。

孙子强调，战争的胜利在很大程度上依赖于情报的准确性和及时性。而获取情报最有效的手段之一便是间谍活动。没有情报，战争决策便成为盲目的猜测，这样的战争不仅风险高，而且胜算极低。正如孙子所言：“知己知彼，百战不殆”。通过间谍活动，能详细了解敌方的动向、战略、内部问题等关键情报，从而为己方的决策提供科学依据。在此过程中，间谍不仅仅是一个工具，更是战略的一部分，一个优秀的君主和将帅，必须善加利用间谍以操控战争节奏，掌握战争主动权。

古代历史中，不乏间谍活动的成功案例。其中最典型的便是春秋战国时期的一些著名战例。齐国的田忌赛马、暗渡陈仓、三十六计中的文种以诈骗夺城、王翦活取咸阳等，无不充满了间谍活动的影子。尤其是秦国的反间活动，在范雎、李斯的谋划下，使燕国大将乐毅自杀，以至于燕国再无力与秦抗衡。正是间谍活动的出色利用，秦国才能逐步统一六国。这些历史案例，不仅仅是古人的智慧结晶，也是对孙子兵法中间谍理论的生动实践。

由此可见，间谍活动是一项复杂而高深的战争艺术，并非简单的奸计或阴谋，而是通过科学的方法、严密的策划和有效的执行来达到最终目标的战略手段。战争不仅仅是兵力、武器的较量，更是智谋与情报的对决。间谍，也因此成为战争中的重要力量。

新时代的我们，虽然面对的战争形式和技术手段已经发生了巨大的变化，但孙子对间谍的重视依旧具有深刻的现实意义。在信息化战争背景下，情报战、网络战成为新的战场。孙子的间谍理论在现代情报工作中依旧有着极高的借鉴价值。如何在复杂的态势中识别信息，如何分辨真假，如何策反敌对势力、利用反间计策，都能从孙子的智慧中找到玄机。

总之，孙子对间谍的分类及其运用方式，不仅为古代战争提供了重要的战略指导，也为现代信息战、情报战提供了宝贵的理论基础。明智的君主和贤能的将帅，应当在孙子智慧的引领下，善加利用间谍，以掌握敌情，取得最终的胜利。",易,GPT-4o,哲学,中文,这段文字讲述了孙子关于间谍重要性的论述，分析了五种间谍（因间、内间、反间、死间、生间）的分类及其运用方式。强调了间谍在战争中的关键作用，指出明智的君主和贤能的将帅应当善加利用间谍，以掌握敌情取得战争胜利。文字还借古代历史实例说明了重用间谍的重要性。,1170

对于敌人派来的刺探我方情报的敌方间谍，也必须把他们搜查出来，之后再用优厚的待遇和金钱来收买他们，对他们进行引诱开导，再放他们回去，这样就可以使他们成为反间，为我所用了。通过反间了解敌情，就能培植、利用因间和内间了；同样，根据反间提供的情报，就能让死间传播假情报给敌人了；由于从反间那里了解了敌情，避开了危险，生间也就可如期回报。这五种间谍的情况，君主都必须了解掌握，而了解情况的关键在于利用反间，所以对反间不可不给予优厚待遇。

以前，殷商的兴起，是因为商汤重用了在夏朝为臣、了解夏朝情况的伊尹；周朝的兴起，是由于周武王重用了了解商朝情况的姜子牙。因此，明智的君主，贤明的将帅，若能使用很有智谋的人做间谍，一定能取得极大的成功。这是用兵作战的关键，是军队行动的依靠。",,,GPT-4o,哲学,中文,这段文字讲述了孙子关于间谍重要性的论述，分析了五种间谍（因间、内间、反间、死间、生间）的分类及其运用方式。强调了间谍在战争中的关键作用，指出明智的君主和贤能的将帅应当善加利用间谍，以掌握敌情取得战争胜利。文字还借古代历史实例说明了重用间谍的重要性。,1170

"天下人都知道美之所以为美，那是由于有丑陋的存在。都知道善之所以为善，那是因为有恶的存在。所以有和无互相转化，难和易互相形成，长和短互相显现，高和下互相充实，音与声互相谐和，前和后互相接随——这是永恒的。因此圣人用无为的观点对待世事，用不言的方式施行教化：听任万物自然兴起而不为其创始，有所施为，但不加自己的倾向，功成业就而不自居。正由于不居功，就无所谓失去。
不推崇有才德的人，导使老百姓不互相争夺；不珍爱难得的财物，导使老百姓不去偷窃；不显耀足以引起贪心的事物，导使民心不被迷乱。因此，圣人的治理原则是：排空百姓的心机，填饱百姓的肚腹，减弱百姓的竞争意图，增强百姓的筋骨体魄，经常使老百姓没有智巧，没有欲望。致使那些有才智的人也不敢妄为造事。圣人按照“无为”的原则去做，办事顺应自然，那么，天才就不会不太平了。
大“道”空虚开形，但它的作用又是无穷无尽。深远啊！它好象万物的祖宗。消磨它的锋锐，消除它的纷扰，调和它的光辉，混同于尘垢。隐没不见啊，又好象实际存在。我不知道它是谁的后代，似乎是天帝的祖先。
天地是无所谓仁慈的，它没有仁爱，对待万事万物就像对待刍狗一样，任凭万物自生自灭。圣人也是没有仁受的，也同样像刍狗那样对待百姓，任凭人们自作自息。天地之间，岂不像个风箱一样吗？它空虚而不枯竭，越鼓动风就越多，生生不息。政令繁多反而更加使人困惑，更行不通，不如保持虚静。","道家哲学自古以来一直强调对立概念的相互依存关系。这种关系不仅存在于美与丑、善与恶、难与易之间，更加深刻地影响着如何治理天下。道家的核心思想，正是基于这种对立统一的认识，提出了独特的治世原则——无为而治。

在道家的视野中，美与丑、善与恶等概念并非绝对存在，而是相互依存、相互转化的。当我们说某事物美，实际上是因为有丑的存在使其相对美；当某种行为被认为是善，那么它的对立面——恶，也因此显现。这样一种动态平衡的观念，正是道家智慧的体现。

对于治理天下，道家提出了“无为而治”的原则。无为，并非什么都不做，而是顺应自然，不做不必要的干涉。圣人通过无为无言来教化和治理百姓，他们并不通过繁杂的政令和训诫来约束人们，而是简化百姓的心思，满足他们的基本需求，使之保持朴素无欲的生活状态。

道家认为，过多的政令反而会带来混乱，与其纷繁复杂，不如保持虚静，得自然之道。天地无所谓仁慈，也无所谓残酷，一切均是自然而然地生发与毁灭。圣人在执政时，也应如天地一般，依照自然的法则行事，而非因人意而肆意施为。

道的作用虽然隐秘，却无穷无尽。它像水一样，不争不抢，却润物无声。水的特性正是道的体现：水利万物而不争，处众人之所恶，故几于道。治理之道，也应如此，不争名、不逐利，而是顺应民心，因势利导。

综上所述，道家的核心思想强调虚静无为的自然法则，这不仅适用于个人修养，更是治理天下的长久之策。面对纷扰复杂的世事，圣人明白，真正的治世之道在于简化而非复杂，顺应而非强制。因此，在道家的智慧中，保持虚静，不因小事动心，尊重自然法则，才是通往和谐与平安的途径。",易,GPT-4o,哲学,中文,这段文字论述了道家的核心思想，特别是对美丑、善恶、难易等对立概念的相互依存关系的认识，强调了圣人无为而治的治世原则。具体包括：世界的美丑、善恶在于相互存在；圣人使用无为无言的方式教化和治理百姓；治理原则是简化百姓的心思，满足他们的基本需求，使他们保持朴实无欲；道的作用虽隐秘却无穷无尽，天地无所谓仁慈，万事万物自生自灭。强调了虚静无为的自然法则，认为过多的政令反而会带来混乱，不如保持虚静得自然之道。,581

"天下人都知道美之所以为美，那是由于有丑陋的存在。都知道善之所以为善，那是因为有恶的存在。所以有和无互相转化，难和易互相形成，长和短互相显现，高和下互相充实，音与声互相谐和，前和后互相接随——这是永恒的。因此圣人用无为的观点对待世事，用不言的方式施行教化：听任万物自然兴起而不为其创始，有所施为，但不加自己的倾向，功成业就而不自居。正由于不居功，就无所谓失去。
不推崇有才德的人，导使老百姓不互相争夺；不珍爱难得的财物，导使老百姓不去偷窃；不显耀足以引起贪心的事物，导使民心不被迷乱。因此，圣人的治理原则是：排空百姓的心机，填饱百姓的肚腹，减弱百姓的竞争意图，增强百姓的筋骨体魄，经常使老百姓没有智巧，没有欲望。致使那些有才智的人也不敢妄为造事。圣人按照“无为”的原则去做，办事顺应自然，那么，天才就不会不太平了。

《大学》提出的‘明明德、亲民、止于至善’，揭示了个人修身的路径与目标。其中，‘明明德’是指彰显个人的光明德性，即通过反思与自省，发现并提升自身的善念与美德；‘亲民’强调的是影响并带动他人，特别是通过自身的德行来感化和引领周围的人；‘止于至善’则是追求至高无上的善，这一过程不仅是个人的修行，更是一种心念的净化与升华。

在详细探讨‘知止而后有定，定而后能静，静而后能安，安而后能虑，虑而后能得’这一提升路径时，我们看到了修身的层层递进关系。‘知止’意味着明确目标，只有在明确目标后，才能专注于实现这一目标，心思才能安定；定下来才能够静心思考，心静则能够坦然处事，从而心安；在心安的状态下，思虑才能够清楚，进而在明晰的思虑中取得成果。这种逻辑推演从一个人的内心状态出发，逐步映射到其外在行为与思维方式，最终成就完整的人格修养。正是这份个人修养，使得个人能够影响家庭，并进一步通过家庭来影响国家与天下。

‘修身’是《大学》中反复强调的重点。在思想上，修身是对自我内心的深刻反省，是自省、自戒、自律的过程。这不仅是道德修养，更是心灵的净化。在行为上，修身要求个人必须行有余力，持之以恒。在现代社会中，修身的重要性依旧不可忽略。个人的道德修养直接影响着家庭关系的和谐，甚至是社会风尚的良好与否。家庭是社会的基本单位，家庭和睦则社会安定，正如古人所言的‘齐家’，即通过规范家庭关系，推而广之，国家自然秩序井然，进而实现‘治国’。

治国与平天下，展现了修身的终极目标与社会意义。个人的道德修养、家庭的和睦关系可以延伸至国家治理，使国家在道德规则、公正原则的基础上运作。进一步，国家安定，天下才能太平。《大学》所描述的这种层层递进的关系，是一种理想状态，也是对个体与社会如何达成和谐、共生目标的古远探索。

《大学》中的哲学理念对当今社会仍有深远的借鉴意义。通过修身，个人可以提升自我道德水平，实现内心和谐；通过齐家，可以推动家庭和睦，促进社会稳定；治国则意味着通过良好的管理与治理，让国家繁荣昌盛，最终实现世界的和平与共生。因此，修身不仅是个人的修养，更是整个社会和天下安宁的基石。

‘修身、齐家、治国、平天下’不仅是《大学》的一种理论，更是对每一个人的一种期许和要求。让我们在日常生活中，以修身为本，做到正心、诚意，进而影响身边的家庭和社会，共同迈向一个和谐美好的世界。",易,GPT-4o,哲学,中文,这段文字主要阐述了《大学》中提出的修身、齐家、治国、平天下的道理，强调个人修身的重要性。通过‘明明德、亲民、止于至善’的理念，逐步实现‘知止而后有定，定而后能静，静而后能安，安而后能虑，虑而后能得’的提升，最终达到个人修身、家庭和睦、国家治理、天下太平。从个人修身、端正心念开始，逐步影响家庭、国家，直到整个天下，强调修身是实现天下太平的根本。这就是‘大学之道’的核心内容。,901

"凡奸臣皆欲顺人主之心以取亲幸之势者也。是以主有所善，臣从而誉之；主有所憎，臣因而毁之。凡人之大体，取舍同者则相是也，取舍异者则相非也。今人臣之所誉者，人主之所是也，此之谓同取；人臣之所毁者，人主之所非也，此之谓同舍。夫取舍合而相与逆者，未尝闻也。此人臣之所以取信幸之道也。夫奸臣得乘信幸之势以毁誉进退群臣者，人主非有术数以御之也，非参验以审之也，必将以曩之合己信今之言，此幸臣之所以得欺主成私者也。故主必蔽于上，而臣必重于下矣，此之谓擅主之臣。

奸臣，一贯是历史长河中的掣肘因素。他们为了自身的权势，往往会通过拍马逢迎、毁誉他人等卑劣手段，来稳固自己在朝中的地位。他们打着忠诚的幌子，实际上却是为了个人私利在谋划。正直之士在其周全的算计下，根本无法施展自身的才智，国家法度得不到有效的执行，最终走向内乱甚至灭亡的边缘。因此，如何看穿奸臣的伪装、夯实治理基础，是君主不可回避的责任。

为了防止奸臣的蔓延，明君应当建立起一套严密的奖惩制度。这不仅是对忠臣的一种激励，更是对奸臣的一种震慑。在这套制度中，奖罚分明，无论是谁，只要有功便应当奖赏，有罪则应当惩罚。透过这套制度，正直之士能看到希望，而奸臣则会有所畏惧，不敢肆意妄为，施展阻碍国家发展的手段。

明君还需注重审查下属的言行。言行，是判定是否忠诚的重要标准。如果一个官员言之凿凿，但行之疏疏，显然他是仅凭言词骗取君主信任的奸臣；而如果一个官员言行一致，且一贯兢兢业业，则可以视为忠臣。在国家治理中，任何忽视对言行审查、仅凭表面判定人才的做法，都是不可取的。只有审查归审查、筛选归筛选，才能从根本上杜绝奸臣的虚伪残酷之风。

此外，君主更需要重视忠臣的培养与使用。他们是国家的栋梁，拥有丰富的才能和清廉的品格，但由于奸臣的阻挠，这些才能无法施展。通过建立健全的选拔机制和奖惩制度，忠臣方能脱颖而出，建言献策，为国家未来指引方向。同时，君主也需时刻关注这些忠臣，为他们提供安心工作的环境，消除他们的后顾之忧，使其全心全意投入到国家建设中。

在历史的长河中，秦孝公的变法是一个成功的例子。秦孝公通过实施商鞅变法，严格奖惩，法令如山，不仅消灭了那些投机取巧、虚伪作伪的小人，也使得贤能之士纷纷归附，从而使得国家日益强盛，为后来秦国的统一奠定了坚实的基础。这一例子无不佐证了通过法治和制度治理国家的重要性。

总结来看，防止奸臣滥用权势，需要明君具备敏锐的辨识力，建立严格的奖惩制度，审查官员的言行，并提供忠臣展示才能的舞台。这样的治理方式，既能削弱奸臣的权势，又能让贤能之士致力于国家建设，最终实现国家的长治久安。历史已经证明，唯有依靠法治和制度，国家才能在风雨飘摇中坚挺迈进。我们从中应当汲取经验，思考如何在现代政治环境中继续发扬这一理念，为未来的发展提供坚实的保障。",易,GPT-4o,哲学,中文,这段文字讨论了君主治理国家时如何防止奸臣滥用权势，导致国家衰败的问题。重点提到奸臣为了个人利益迎合君主，通过毁誉他人来巩固自身地位，导致正直之士无法施展才智，国家法度难以执行。文章提出明君应通过设立确定的奖惩制度，审查下属言行，杜绝虚伪残酷之风，确保忠臣得以发挥才能，使国家长治久安。最后以秦孝公变法的成功例子佐证，强调依靠法治和制度管理国家的重要性。,1495

"自从《国风》、《大雅》、《小雅》的歌声停息后，没有人继续创作那样的作品了，有一种奇特的妙文蓬勃兴起，那就是《离骚》啊！它确实已高翔在《诗经》的作者之后，奋飞于两汉辞赋家之前，大概是距离圣人孔子的时代不算久远，而楚国人又有才华的缘故吧！从前汉武帝喜爱《离骚》，淮南王刘安便作了《离骚传》，他认为：“《国风》描写爱情但不过分，《小雅》抒写怨愤而有节制，像《离骚》这样的文辞，可以说兼有两方面的长处。屈原像蝉蜕从污泥中蜕变出来，在尘埃之外浮游，他皎洁的品质用黑色去染也不会变色，就是与日月争比光辉也是可以的。”班固认为：屈原喜欢显露才华，宣扬自己，以至于心怀怨恨，投江自杀；《离骚》中所说后羿、过浇和二姚的故事，跟《左传》中的记载不一致；昆仑和悬圃，也都是经书上所没有的；然而他的文辞艳丽雅正，是辞赋家效法的宗师，虽然他不是明智之士，但可以说是一个才艺超群的人。王逸认为：《诗经》的作者讽谏，是提着人耳去劝戒，屈原则是委婉和顺的，《离骚》中的文辞，依据经书立论；如说驾龙乘凤，就是来自《易经》中时常驾驭六龙的说法；登昆仑、涉流沙，就是来自《尚书·禹贡》中关于禹治理水土的记载。后代著名学者的辞赋，没有不摹仿它以为法度的。真可以说是“有金玉一样的质地，百代以来没有能与它相匹敌的”。到了汉代，宣帝赞美《离骚》，认为它完全符合经书的义理；扬雄吟诵品味，也说它的体制风貌和《诗经》的《大雅》、《小雅》相同。刘安、王逸、汉宣帝、扬雄四家，都拿它与经书相比，只有班固说它与经传不合。这些赞扬和贬抑都是信口谈论，离开了作品的实际，可以说是品鉴得不精当，玩味而没有做切实地考核。
要核实他们的评论，必须征引原作来检验。《离骚》中陈述尧、舜的光明正大，赞美禹、汤的威严恭敬，就是学习《尚书》中典、诰的体制；讥讽桀、纣的狂妄放纵，伤悼后羿、过浇的坠落覆亡，这是符合《诗经》中规劝讽谏的意旨；《涉江》中以虬龙来比喻君子，《离骚》中用云霓来比喻好进谗言的小人，这是《诗经》中比兴的表现手法；《哀郢》里说每一次回望故国都要落泪，《九辩》中感叹楚王宫门有九重，难于见君，完全是《诗经》中忠而怀怨的言辞。从这四点来看，是《楚辞》和《诗经》相同的地方。至于《离骚》假托龙和云旗，谈说怪异的事情，令丰隆驾彩云去寻求宓妃，托靠鸩鸟做媒去向娀女求婚，都是奇诡怪异的说法；《天问》里说共工撞倒天柱使大地倾斜，后羿射落九个太阳，《招魂》里说拔木的巨人有九个头，土地神有三只眼，都是诡诈怪异的传说；《离骚》里说要依照彭咸去投水，《悲回风》里说要跟随伍子胥沉江以求得快意，这是性情狷介、心胸狭隘的表现；《招魂》把男女杂坐，混乱不分，说成是乐事，把狂饮不止，日夜酣醉，当做快乐，这是荒唐淫邪的思想。摘引出这四点，是《楚辞》与经书不同的地方。
所以说《离骚》合乎经典之处就像前边那样，说它夸张怪诞则像后边这样。由此可知《楚辞》的体制是仿效三代的经典，可它的风格里又夹杂有战国纵横家的风气，比起《雅》、《颂》来他们是轻狂放荡之徒，但在辞赋中却是杰出的英才了。看看它所树立的主旨，所比附的文辞，虽然汲取融合了经书的意旨，但也独创了奇伟瑰丽的文辞。所以《离骚》、《九章》，用明朗艳丽的文辞抒发哀怨的情志；《九歌》、《九辩》，以柔美靡丽的辞藻抒写哀伤的情感；《远游》、《天问》，奇特瑰丽而又构思精巧；《招魂》、《大招》，光彩艳丽而又潜藏着内在的美；《卜居》标举旷放的情致，《渔父》寄托着特立独行的才情。所以它的气势能超越古人，文辞能横绝当代，文采惊人，华美绝伦，别的作品是很难与它媲美的。",《离骚》是一部古代文学的瑰宝，其作者屈原不仅在文学史上占据重要地位，而且在文辞的运用和情感的表达方面具有独到的艺术风格。屈原作为战国时期璀璨的文化之星，其创作开启了中国文学的新纪元。《离骚》在《国风》、《大雅》和《小雅》偃息之后，独自绽放出光彩，树立了难以企及的文学高峰。与两汉辞赋家相比，《离骚》独具特色，不仅继承了《诗经》的讽刺劝谏精神，还开创了属于自己的一片天地，以奇特瑰丽的语言风格留传千古。一方面，屈原的作品具备传统经典的优点；另一方面，他的文辞充满了战国纵横家的风气，甚至涵盖了一些夸张怪诞的表达手法。然而，正是这种独特的风貌造就了《离骚》在辞赋历史上的杰出地位。屈原通过《离骚》表达了对现实的不屑和对理想的追求，文采斐然，情感丰富，远远超越了前人的文辞和气势。从文体结构到语言艺术，从情感表达到思想内涵，屈原在《离骚》中无不展现出卓越的才华和深邃的思考。《离骚》不仅是一部文学巨著，更是一部充满哲理和人文关怀的作品，为后世文学和文化的发展提供了无尽的灵感和启迪。,易,GPT-4o,哲学,中文,这段文字主要讨论了《离骚》及其作者屈原的文辞特点和文学地位。文中提到《离骚》在《国风》、《大雅》、《小雅》停息后兴起，与两汉辞赋家相比有其独特之处。《离骚》既有《诗经》的讽谏之意，又有自己独特的奇特瑰丽文辞。评论中提到，屈原的文辞既有传统经典的优点，又包含了战国纵横家的风气，虽然有夸张怪诞之处，但在辞赋中仍是杰出的作品。最后总结认为《离骚》及其相关作品在文采和情感表达方面极为出色，超越了古人的文辞和气势。,1461

"举凡用兵先要争取具备的条件是：圣人贤士不为贪图尊高的爵位，有道术能力的人不为贪图国家的官职，有武艺勇力的人不为优厚的俸禄，到敌方侦查的人员不为金钱和财货。伯夷、叔齐不是饿死以后才有名的，因为以前就注重修德；周武王不是在甲子那天以后取胜的，因为以前就多行善政。
所以，小规模的征战，要了解千里地的情况。就是一墙之隔，十人之聚集，也要每天侦查五次。至于大规模的征战，那就要了解天下的情况了。所谓每日频繁地侦查五次，就是要花钱购买耳目的意思。所以，善用兵者，即使没有沟垒工事，也要有从事侦查的耳目。兵不可高声呼警，不可草率集合，不可徒劳行军，不可勉强进攻。高声呼警，则敌人知所警惕；草率集合出动，则兵众不肯效力；徒劳行军，则士卒困乏；勉强进攻，则精兵受挫。所以，用兵的人，攻坚则容易受挫，攻弱则收得神效。攻坚，其薄弱环节也会变得坚固；攻弱，其坚固部分也会变得薄弱。所以要稳住其坚固环节，削弱其薄弱环节。屠牛坦一天割解九只牛而屠刀还能削铁，就是因为刀刃总是在空隙间活动的原故。所以，在天道不顺的时候，敌人穷屈，也不宜追逐；敌国人事荒乱，就可以以十破百；敌国兵器不备，就可以以半击倍，所以，军事争夺不打坚固的城池，有道义的不打无君的国家。要使人不知其将要来到，到了就无法防御；要使人不知其将要离去，去了便不能阻止。这样敌人虽多，也是不能阻拦和防御的。
治，可以导致国富，但治未必就是富，必须懂得富国的生产，然后才能富。富，可以导致国强，但富未必就是强，必须懂得强国的措施，然后才能强。强，可以导致胜利，但强未必就能胜，必须懂得胜利的正理，然后才能胜。胜，可以导致控制天下，但胜未必就能控制，必须懂得控制天下的纲领，然后才能控制。所以，使国治要有军备，使国富要有生产，使国强要有措施，使国胜要有理，控制天下则要有纲领。",在探索用兵与治理国家的原则过程中，我们可以将这两方面的策略总结为深思熟虑和有效执行的范畴。在军事行动中，了解敌情是首要任务，因此广泛侦查是不可或缺的基本步骤，不仅要了解敌方的实力和布置，还需掌握其战略与战术，以未雨绸缪，筹划全局。尽量避免攻打那些防御坚固的城池，因为耗费资源和时间之后未必能取得胜利，反而可能自损实力。高声呼叫警报或草率集合部队都可能在敌方察觉之前暴露我方意图，使作战变得危险。而且，既要避免徒劳无功的行军，又要在进攻时注重谨慎，不强迫部队进行在没有把握的战斗。最终，制定战略时应尽力寻找并打击敌方的弱点，以最小的成本获得最大的战果。治理国家亦有其独特的法则。在纷繁复杂的治国过程中，有条不紊地规划和执行政策至关重要。首先，要拥有强大的军备以确保国家的安全和治国的稳定，这不仅是抵御外敌的基本保障，也是内部安全的基础。在此基础上，生产是国富的根本。经济的发展和丰富的物资供应可以提高人民的生活水平，增强国民的忠诚和凝聚力。进一步，必须有有效的政策措施来引导和调节国家的发展方向，保证国家能够在风雨飘摇中始终沿着正确的轨道前行。同时，国家应紧握胜理，即应对纷繁复杂局势的智慧和策略，确保凡事都井井有条，避免陷入无谓的纠纷与危机。纲领的制定和贯彻是国家保持强大战斗力和竞争力的核心。纲领如同国家的灵魂，领导整个国家在复杂多变的国际环境中保持坚定的方向与步伐。通过这些纲领，国家不仅能有效管理国内事务，还能在国际舞台上占据有利地位，积极掌控并引导天下局势。在总结这两方面的原则时，我们可以看到，军事策略和治理国家的核心都在于深思熟虑和有效执行。无论是防务还是内政，都需要在明确目标和深刻理解局势的基础上采取科学合理的对策。用兵重在智略，在了解敌我双方的优劣势后，以最优的方式打击敌方的致命弱点。治国则在于精细管理，通过各种措施确保国家在安全、富足和稳健的发展轨道上不断前进。最终，能够成功的国家必然是拥有强大策略和执行力的国家，这不仅能在短期内解决问题，更能在长远的未来中保持持续的胜利与繁荣。,易,GPT-4o,哲学,中文,这段文字主要探讨了用兵和治理国家的原则。用兵要广泛侦查敌情，不打坚固城池，不高声呼警，不草率集合，不徒劳行军，不勉强进攻，善攻其弱点。治理国家则需有军备使国治，有生产使国富，有措施使国强，有胜理使国胜，有纲领使国控制天下。,751

"在甲子日的黎明时分，周武王率领大军来到商朝都城郊外的牧野，在这里举行誓师。武王左手拿着铜制大斧，右手拿着白色 的指挥旗，说道：“辛苦了，远道而来的西方将士们１
武王说：“啊！我们尊敬的友邦国君和执事大臣，各位司徒、司马、司空、亚旅、师氏、千夫长、百夫长，还有庸、蜀、羌、髦、 微、卢、彭、濮诸邦的将士们，举起你们的戈，排列好你们的盾，用竖起你们的矛，我要发布誓师令了。”
武王说：“古人说过：‘母鸡在早晨不打鸣；如果谁家母鸡早 晨打鸣，这个家就要衰落了。’现在商纣王只是听信妇人的话，轻副蔑地抛弃了对祖先的祭祖而不闻不问，抛弃他的先王的后裔，不任用同宗的长辈和兄弟，却对四方八面的罪人逃犯十分崇敬、信任、提拔、任用，让他们当上大夫、卿士，使他们残暴虐待老百 姓，在商国都城胡作非为。现在我姬发要恭敬地按上天的意志来 讨伐商纣。今天这场战斗，行进中不超过六步、七步，就要停下 来整顿队伍。努力吧，将士们！作战中刺杀不超过四次、五次、六 次、七次，然后停下来整顿。努力吧，将士们！你们要威武雄壮，像虎、豹、熊、罴一样勇猛，在商都郊外大战一常不要迎击向我们投降的人，以便让他们为我们服务。努力吧，将士们！如果 你们不努力，你们自身就会遭到杀戮",在哲学的时空中，不妨以周武王黎明誓师为起点来反思人类意志、权力和道德规范的复杂纠葛。彼时，武王携大军抵达商朝都城郊外牧野，天色微亮，空气中弥漫着一股肃杀的气氛。他手握铜斧和指挥旗，面向从四面八方赶来的将士，目光坚定而透彻，表达了对他们的深切问候。然而，背后折射的是一段关乎政治与伦理的深邃思考。武王的誓师辞中，通过严词斥责商纣王的暴政，深刻揭示了力量与公义的微妙平衡：商纣王的信任局限于妇人言，蔑视祖先，重用罪犯，致使百姓在苦难中挣扎。武王将这些恶行与天命联系起来，以此为立场，呈现出一种“天意”作为道德绝对者的叙述，从而为自身的征伐行为提供了正当性依据。然而，探讨天意的意义与人类意志的选择过程，不禁引发对自由与命运的哲学思索：天命是否真正主宰着人类的行为？抑或这只是权力的工具、伦理的遮蔽？在对武王特别强调作战纪律和策略的片段中，尽显他的战略智慧。他要求将士们勇猛作战，像虎豹熊罴，但不可攻击投降者，以便“为己所用”，同时警告那些不努力作战者将遭遇杀戮。此处凸显的正是对人的双重观照：一方面，他视己方将士为实现目标的工具，强调纪律与服从的重要性；另一方面，他饱含策略且不乏仁德地对待投降者，尝试将其纳入自己的阵营，以增强自身实力。这种“以人为手段”的义务伦理，待人以策略的智慧，反映了古代权力斗争中的人性哲学。而在人类历史的长河中，每一个战争决定、每一场政权轮替，都仿佛在演绎着一场关系和道德、权力和信仰、自由和命运之间的复杂博弈。武王之黎明誓师，正是其间一幕深刻而耐人寻味的画面，既昭示了古代哲学智慧，也激起对当代人类存在困境的无尽思考。,易,GPT-4o,哲学,中文,周武王在黎明时分，率领大军来到商朝都城郊外的牧野，举行誓师大会。武王手持铜斧和指挥旗，向远道而来的将士们致以问候。他告诫大家商纣王如何只听信妇人的话，蔑视祖先，重用罪犯，使百姓受苦，并表达了自己按上天意志讨伐商纣的决心。武王特别强调作战纪律和策略，要求将士们勇猛作战，像虎豹熊罴一样，但不要攻击投降者，以便他们能够为己所用，同时警告不努力作战者将会遭遇杀戮。,508

周穆王时，最西方的国家有个能幻化的人来到中国，他能进入水火之中，穿过金属岩石，能翻倒山河，移动城市，悬在空中不会坠落，碰到实物不被阻碍，千变万化，无穷无尽，既能改变事物的形状，又能改变人的思虑。穆王对他像天神一样的尊敬，像国君一样的侍奉，把自己的寝宫让出来让他居住，用祭把神灵的膳食给他吃喝，选择美丽的女子乐队供他娱乐。可是这个幻化人却认为穆王的宫殿太低太差不可以居住，穆王的膳食又腥又臭不可以享用，穆王的嫔妃又羶又丑不可以亲近。于是穆王便为他另筑宫殿，土木建筑、雕梁画栋，以至于到了不能再巧妙的程度。穆王把府库的钱财全部耗尽，才把楼台建成。楼台高达八千尺，比终南山还要高，称作中天之台，挑选郑国和卫国美丽而苗条的女子，体洒香水，修饰娥眉，戴上首饰耳环，穿上东阿的细布，拖上齐国的绢绸，涂脂抹粉，描眉画唇，佩珠玉，戴手镯，再带上各种香草去充满这座楼台，演奏《承云》、《六莹》、《九韶》、《晨露》等动听的音乐使他快乐，每月送去最美的衣服，每天送上最美的膳食。可是那位幻化人还不高兴，不得已才进去。没住多久，他邀请穆王一同出去游玩。穆王拉着他的衣袖，便腾云而上，到天的中央才停下来。接着便到了幻化人的宫殿。幻化人的宫殿用金银建筑，以珠玉装饰，在白云与雷雨之上，不知道它下面以什么为依托，看上去好像是屯留在白云之中。耳朵听到的，眼睛看到的，鼻子闻到的，口舌尝到的，都是人间所没有的东西。穆王真以为到了清都、紫微、钧天、广乐这些天帝所居住的地方。穆王低下头往地面上看去，见自己的宫殿楼台简直像累起来的上块和堆起来的茅草。穆王自己觉得即使在这里住上几十年也不会想念自己的国家的。幻化人又请穆王一同游玩。所到之处，抬头看不见太阳月亮，低头看不见江河海洋。光影照来，穆王眼花缭乱看不清楚；音响传来，穆王耳鸣声乱听不明白。百骸六脏，全都颤抖而不能平静。意志昏迷，精神丧失，于是请求幻化人带他回去。幻化人推了一把，穆王好像跌落到了虚空之中。醒来以后，还是坐在原来的地方，左右还是原来侍候他的人。看看眼前的东西，那水酒是刚倒出来的，菜肴是刚烧好的。穆王问左右：“我刚才是从哪里来的？”左右的人说：“大王不过是默默地待了一会儿。”从此穆王精神恍愧了三个月才恢复正常。再问幻化人。幻化人说：“我与大王的精神出去游玩罢了，形体何尝移动过呢？而且您在天上居住的宫殿，与大王的宫殿有什么不同呢？您在天上游玩的花园，与大王的花园有什么不同呢？大王习惯了经常看到的东西，对暂时的变化感到怀疑。其实即使是最大的变化，无论是慢一点的变化还是快一点的变化，哪能都如实地描绘出来呢？”穆王十分高兴，从此不过问国家大事，不亲近大臣与嫔妃，毫无顾忌地到遥远的地方去游玩，他下令用天下最好的八种骏马来驾车，右边的服马叫骅骝，左边的服马叫绿耳，右边的骏马叫赤骥，左边的骖马叫白牺。穆王的马车由造父驾驭，泰丙为车右。随从的马车，右边的服马叫渠黄，左边的服马叫踰轮，左边的骖马叫盗骊，右边的骏马叫山子，由柏夭主车，参百驾驭，奔戎为车右。驰驱了一千里，到了巨蒐氏的国家。巨蒐氏于是献上白鹄的血液供穆王饮用，准备牛马的乳汁给穆王洗脚，并供奉所有乘车与驾车的人。吃喝以后继续前进，又歇宿在崑山的弯曲处，赤水的北面。第二天便登上了崑 山巅，观览了黄帝的宫殿，并修缮整新，以传于后世。随后又成西王母的贵宾，在瑶池上宴饮。西王母为穆王朗诵歌谣，穆王也跟着唱和，歌辞都很悲哀。后来又观赏了太阳入山的情景，一天走了一万里。穆王于是叹道：“哎呀！我不修养道德而只知道享乐，后世的人恐怕要谴责我的罪过了吧！”穆王难道是神人吗？在一生中享尽了快乐，仍然活了一百岁才死，当时的人们还以为他升天了呢。,"周穆王时期，一个能变幻莫测的人来到中国，其形态如水般多变，炫目的表演让任何一位见证者都为之惊叹。作为统治者，穆王不仅对这个神秘的来客心生敬畏，更为其大力建造了一座奢华的宫殿，希望以此表达尊敬。然而，这位幻化人对外在的形式和华美的建筑却不甚在意，他更关注的是内在境界的探索与精神层面的提升。

某一天，幻化人邀穆王进行一次别开生面的灵魂之旅。通过冥想和内省的方式，穆王的灵魂似乎脱离了肉体，在幻化人的指引下，开始了一次前所未有的天外游历。在这段旅程中，穆王看到了难以言传的壮丽景象。天上的星辰、云海，神秘的宇宙力量，无一不令穆王感叹宇宙之浩大。身体内的感官在短时间内经历了无数美好的事物，芳香扑鼻的花朵，温暖的阳光，沁人心脾的风，这些奇妙的感觉让穆王精神恍惚、心神游离。在回到现实后，穆王对之前一切的时间、王位和权力重新审视起来。

自此，穆王不再全心全意地处理国事，而是选择了一种更为洒脱和放纵的人生态度，他命人做好安排，开始四处游历。在他的旅程中，他到达了巨蒐氏的国家、经过崑山，看到了传说中的黄帝宫殿，并与掌管西天仙界的西王母在瑶池上宴饮。这些奇妙的经历使穆王的精神更加开阔，他开始追求一种超越世俗、追求心灵自由的生活方式。

在巨蒐氏的国家里，穆王看到了一个截然不同的社会结构，那里的人民朴实、平和，他们教 导他许多关于天人合一、顺应自然的哲理。在崑山，他看到了天地万物的生生不息之道，以及自然的壮美与神秘。在黄帝的宫殿，穆王感受到了古人智慧的深邃与遗产的厚重；在与西王母的宴饮中，穆王体验到了极高的精神境界所带来的无尽快乐。即使这一切都如梦似幻，但对于穆王来说，却刻骨铭心。

这种另辟蹊径的人生体验，使穆王有了更加开阔的宇宙观和人生观。他开始反思自己的过去，是否太过于沉迷于权力与财富，而忽略了精神的自由与心灵的宁和。他意识到，真正的快乐并不是通过外在的富贵荣华得来的，而是一种内在的平和与满足。

穆王感叹道：“我虽然未曾修养道德，但这一生却享尽了快乐。”这句简单的话语道出了他重新认识人生的真谛。快乐，不在于外在的物质拥有，而在乎心灵的自由与精神的超脱。他以一种更为高远的眼光，审视人世间的纷争与困苦，顿悟到：世间的得失荣辱，原不过如浮云一般。

最终，穆王活到了百岁高龄。在这漫长的人生旅程中，他经历了超凡的感官体验和心灵的洗礼，这使他能以一种豁达的态度对待生死。当他离开人世时，人们认为他并未真正离开，而是升天去了，或许在某个未知的境界继续他的探索。在这一过程中，穆王不仅个人得到了极大的精神解放，他也向世人展现了另一种生活态度：追求内心的宁和、自我的实现以及对道的修养。

这个故事不仅是对穆王一生的总结，更是对人类追求精神自由、内心满足的一种深刻启示。透过对自身内在境界的探索，人们可以找到一种超越物质的快乐，体会到真正自由的可贵。",易,GPT-4o,哲学,中文,周穆王时期，一个能变幻莫测的人来到中国，展示了种种超凡能力，穆王对他尊敬有加，为其建造华美的宫殿。然而，幻化人对这些不满，带穆王体验了一次神奇的灵魂之旅。穆王在幻化人的帮助下，在天上看到了极为壮丽的景象，短时间内经历了极为丰富的感官体验，醒来后精神恍惚。此后，穆王不再关心国家事务，四处游历，游览了巨蒐氏的国家、崑山和黄帝的宫殿，还与西王母在瑶池上宴饮。最后，穆王自叹没有修养道德但享尽了快乐，活到一百岁才去世，人们认为他升天了。,1509

"上古还没有形成天地的时候，只有模糊不清的状态而无具体形状，这种状态是昏暗幽深、混沌不清，无法知道它的门道。那时有陰陽二神同时产生，一起营造天地；其深远得不知它的尽头，宽广得不知它的边缘。这时便分出天地陰陽，散离成四方八极，陰陽二气互相作用，万物才从中产生形成。这里，杂乱的气产生鱼鸟禽兽和昆虫，而纯精的气则产生人类。因此，人的精神归属于上天，而形骸归属于大地。如果人死以后，精神归属于上天、形骸归属于大地，那“我”还有什么存剩呢？所以圣人遵循天地的运行规则、顺应人的本性，不为世俗所拘束、不被人欲所诱惑，以天为父，以地为母，以陰陽变化、四时运行为准则。天清澈而洁静、地平定而安宁，万物离开它就死亡，依附它就生存。
静漠，是神明的住宅；虚无，是道的居所。因此，只追求身外之物，就会失去对内心精神世界的保养持守，反过来对某些事情一直耿耿于怀，就会影响人体外形的健康。这就好比树根与树梢的关系，从根本上牵引着树根主干，树的千枝万叶也就无不随之摇动。
人的精神是从上天那里得到的；而形体则是从大地那里得到的。所以说“道生陰陽二气，陰陽二气产生出中和之气，万物均从中和之气中产生。万物背陰而抱陽，陰陽激荡而成和气”。所以说人的生命体产生的过程是：一个月成脂膏状态，二个月变成肿块形状，三个月成胎，四个月生肌肉，五个月长筋络，六个月长骨骼，七个月成人形，八个月胎儿会动弹，九个月则躁动于母腹，十个月就呱呱落地。人之形体一旦形成后，内在五脏也随之形成。所以是肺主管眼，肾主管鼻，胆主管口，肝主管耳。外表五官和内部五脏，开闭张合，各自互相联系着。所以人的脑袋呈圆形，象天，脚呈方形，象地。天有四季、五行、九大分野、三百六十六天，人则也有四肢、五脏、九窍和三百六十经脉。天有风雨寒暑，人则也有取予喜怒。所以这样又可将胆配云，肺配气，肝配风，肾配雨，脾配雷，以此来与天地自然相参验伍配，而这当中心脏是主宰物。因此人的耳目如同天上的日月，气血如同自然之风雨。日中有三足乌，而月中有蟾蜍。日月如果不按常规运行，就会出现昏淡无光的日月蚀；风雨如果不合时令降临，就会毁折农作物而生灾害；五星如果失常运行，它所对应的国家就会遭殃。
天地之道宏大深邃，尚且还要节制，珍惜其光彩，人的耳目又怎能长久劳累而不休息呢？人的精神又怎能长久驰骋而不耗尽呢？所以说人的气血和五脏是人的精华。血气如能专注聚集在五脏之内而不外溢，那么这胸腹内的五脏就充实而嗜欲也随之减少。五脏充实而嗜欲减少，就能使耳目清明、视听就畅达。耳目清明、视听畅达，叫做“明”。五脏能归属于心而不与心违逆，这样旺盛之气占优势而使人行为不乖悖、怪僻，人的精神就旺盛而精气不散泄。精神旺盛和精气不散泄则顺畅，顺畅就调匀，调匀则通达无阻，通达无阻就能产生出神奇的能力。这种能力能使人视无不见、听无不闻，没有什么事办不成的。这样，忧患祸害就不会侵入，邪气歪风也无法侵扰。
因此有些事情到四海之外去追求寻找却不能得到，有些则持守在身体之内却不能见效。所以贪多则反而获得少，看见大的反而所知甚少。人的五官七窍是精神的门窗，而气血则是五脏的使者。如果耳目沉溺在声色当中，那么五脏就会动荡不安。五脏动荡不安，那么血气就会激荡不休。血气激荡不休，那么精神就会驰骋在外而不能内守。精神驰骋在外不能持守，那么灾祸就会来临，即使祸大如山丘，你也没法感觉得到。所以，如果让耳目精明通畅而不受外界的诱惑、气志虚静恬愉而省却嗜欲、五脏安宁充盈而不外泄、精神持守于内心而不外越，那么即使是遥远的往事和未来的事情也不够你所认识的，更何况只是觉察眼前一些祸福之间的事情呢！所以说“精神逸出内心越远，所知道的就越少”。这就充分说明精神是不能外泄散逸的。所以，五色迷乱眼睛，使双目昏暗不明；五声哗乱耳朵，使双耳堵塞不聪；五味扰乱舌味，使口舌麻木无味；追逐名利而惑乱心性，使人行为放荡不羁。这四样东西，世间一般性的人是用来养生的，但实际上却是人生的累赘。所以说，嗜欲使人精气散逸，而爱憎之情则使人心力疲惫，假如不赶快清除它们，就会使人气血日耗殆尽。","在一切初始的混沌之中，宇宙诞生了阴阳二气。这两个基本的力量互相作用，推动了万物的产生和变化，从而形成了我们所看到的世界。在这种宏大背景下，我们试图深入探讨人与天地自然之间的关系，这不仅仅是空间和物质的联结，更是精神和形骸的交织与互映。

首先，宇宙的生成和运行离不开阴阳二气的相互作用。阴阳之气不仅造就了天地万物，也孕育了人类自身。人类作为宇宙的一部分，他们的存在不仅仅依赖于身体形骸，更重要的是精神的维系。精神源自于上天，是一种高于物质的存在；形骸源自于大地，是肉体的具体体现。这两者的关系非但不是对立的，而是共生共存、相互依存的。

精神与形体的内在联系揭示了人类存在的深刻奥秘。精神作为一种无形的力量，它通过形体表现出来，同时也受到形体的影响。正因为如此，保持精神与形体的平衡变得尤为重要。在现代社会，追求身外之物成为了一种普遍现象，但这种追求往往会导致内心精神的损害。心灵的迷失和内在的空虚，是物质过度膨胀的副产品。而保持精神内守，则能够使人心志清明，五脏安宁，从而避免外界灾祸的侵扰。

心志的清明不仅是一种心理状态，更是与天地自然和谐共处的方法。人作为天地之间的产物，其身心与天地自然息息相关。精神的回归，源自对自然规律的遵循和对自身本质的反思。气血内守和精神恬静，是维持身心健康的重要方面。保持精神和气血的内守，不仅能够使人体的五脏六腑处于和谐的状态，还能够调节整个生命系统，使之达到一种自我修复和平衡的能力。

然而，现代生活中，嗜欲和情感的泛滥成为精神健康的一大威胁。过度的情感波动和嗜欲，会耗散精气，从而损害身体的健康。情感的过度往往会导致精神的疲惫和内心的焦虑，这种状态不仅破坏了内心的平静，也影响了气血的流动。古人常说：“养心莫过于寡欲”，这不仅是为精神安宁提供了指导，更为身心和谐奠定了基础。

欲望的节制和情感的平衡，是实现内心平静的重要途径。通过内观和冥想，个体可以与自身的精神层面进行深度对话，理解自己的内在需求，平衡外界与内心的关系。这样的自省和自律，不仅能够保持气血的稳定，还可以促进精神的成长和心性的提升。

综上所述，人与天地自然的关系不仅体现在物质层面，更渗透在精神的交融之中。精神源自上天，形骸源自大地，二者相互影响、相互依存。保持精神内守和气血调和，是实现心志清明、五脏安宁的关键。而节制欲望、平衡情感，是避免精神耗散、维护身体健康的重要途径。在不断追求外在物质的同时，不应忽视内在精神的修养。只有在物质与精神的和谐中，才能真正实现身心的安宁与灵魂的升华。这不仅是个人幸福的源泉，更是与天地自然和谐共处的哲学智慧。",易,GPT-4o,哲学,中文,这段文字讲述了宇宙从混沌状态中诞生阴阳二气互相作用产生万物，并详细阐述了人与天地自然的关系。强调人的精神源自上天，形骸源自大地，揭示了精神与形体的内在联系。同时，指出追求身外之物会损害内心精神，而保持精神内守则能使人心志清明，五脏安宁，避免灾祸侵扰。强调保持精神和气血的内守与恬静的重要性，警示嗜欲和情感过度会导致精气耗散，进而损害健康。,1662

"21. Were it necessary to add any FURTHER PROOF AGAINST THE EXISTENCE OF MATTER after what has been said, I could instance several of those errors and difficulties (not to mention impieties) which have sprung from that tenet. It has occasioned numberless controversies and disputes in philosophy, and not a few of far greater moment in religion. But I shall not enter into the detail of them in this place, as well because I think arguments A POSTERIORI are unnecessary for confirming what has been, if I mistake not, sufficiently demonstrated A PRIORI, as because I shall hereafter find occasion to speak somewhat of them.
22. I am afraid I have given cause to think I am needlessly prolix in handling this subject. For, to what purpose is it to dilate on that which may be demonstrated with the utmost evidence in a line or two, to any one that is capable of the least reflexion? It is but looking into your own thoughts, and so trying whether you can conceive it possible for a sound, or figure, or motion, or colour to exist without the mind or unperceived. This easy trial may perhaps make you see that what you contend for is a downright contradiction. Insomuch that I am content to put the whole upon this issue:--If you can but CONCEIVE it possible for one extended movable substance, or, in general, for any one idea, or anything like an idea, to exist otherwise than in a mind perceiving it, I shall readily give up the cause. And, as for all that COMPAGES of external bodies you contend for, I shall grant you its existence, THOUGH (1.) YOU CANNOT EITHER GIVE ME ANY REASON WHY YOU BELIEVE IT EXISTS [Vide sect. lviii.], OR (2.) ASSIGN ANY USE TO IT WHEN IT IS SUPPOSED TO EXIST [Vide sect. lx.]. I say, the bare possibility of your opinions being true shall pass for an argument that it is so. [Note: i.e. although your argument be deficient in the two requisites of an hypothesis.--Ed.]
23. But, say you, surely there is nothing easier than for me to imagine trees, for instance, in a park, or books existing in a closet, and nobody by to perceive them. I answer, you may so, there is no difficulty in it; but what is all this, I beseech you, more than framing in your mind certain ideas which you call BOOKS and TREES, and the same time omitting to frame the idea of any one that may perceive them? BUT DO NOT YOU YOURSELF PERCEIVE OR THINK OF THEM ALL THE WHILE? This therefore is nothing to the purpose; it only shows you have the power of imagining or forming ideas in your mind: but it does not show that you can conceive it possible the objects of your thought may exist without the mind. To make out this, IT IS NECESSARY THAT YOU CONCEIVE THEM EXISTING UNCONCEIVED OR UNTHOUGHT OF, WHICH IS A MANIFEST REPUGNANCY. When we do our utmost to conceive the existence of external bodies, we are all the while only contemplating our own ideas. But the mind taking no notice of itself, is deluded to think it can and does conceive bodies existing unthought of or without the mind, though at the same time they are apprehended by or exist in itself. A little attention will discover to any one the truth and evidence of what is here said, and make it unnecessary to insist on any other proofs against the existence of material substance.
24. THE ABSOLUTE EXISTENCE OF UNTHINKING THINGS ARE WORDS WITHOUT A MEANING.--It is very obvious, upon the least inquiry into our thoughts, to know whether it is possible for us to understand what is meant by the ABSOLUTE EXISTENCE OF SENSIBLE OBJECTS IN THEMSELVES, OR WITHOUT THE MIND. To me it is evident those words mark out either a direct contradiction, or else nothing at all. And to convince others of this, I know no readier or fairer way than to entreat they would calmly attend to their own thoughts; and if by this attention the emptiness or repugnancy of those expressions does appear, surely nothing more is requisite for the conviction. It is on this therefore that I insist, to wit, that the ABSOLUTE existence of unthinking things are words without a meaning, or which include a contradiction. This is what I repeat and inculcate, and earnestly recommend to the attentive thoughts of the reader.
25. THIRD ARGUMENT.[Note: Vide sect. iii. and vii.]--REFUTATION OF LOCKE.--All our ideas, sensations, notions, or the things which we perceive, by whatsoever names they may be distinguished, are visibly inactive--there is nothing of power or agency included in them. So that ONE IDEA or object of thought CANNOT PRODUCE or make ANY ALTERATION IN ANOTHER. To be satisfied of the truth of this, there is nothing else requisite but a bare observation of our ideas. For, since they and every part of them exist only in the mind, it follows that there is nothing in them but what is perceived: but whoever shall attend to his ideas, whether of sense or reflexion, will not perceive in them any power or activity; there is, therefore, no such thing contained in them. A little attention will discover to us that the very being of an idea implies passiveness and inertness in it, insomuch that it is impossible for an idea to do anything, or, strictly speaking, to be the cause of anything: neither can it be the resemblance or pattern of any active being, as is evident from sect. 8. Whence it plainly follows that extension, figure, and motion cannot be the cause of our sensations. To say, therefore, that these are the effects of powers resulting from the configuration, number, motion, and size of corpuscles, must certainly be false. [Note: Vide sect. cii.]
26. CAUSE OF IDEAS.--We perceive a continual succession of ideas, some are anew excited, others are changed or totally disappear. There is therefore some cause of these ideas, whereon they depend, and which produces and changes them. That this cause cannot be any quality or idea or combination of ideas, is clear from the preceding section. It must therefore be a substance; but it has been shown that there is no corporeal or material substance: it remains therefore that the CAUSE OF IDEAS is an incorporeal active substance or Spirit.
27. NO IDEA OF SPIRIT.--A spirit is one simple, undivided, active being--as it perceives ideas it is called the UNDERSTANDING, and as it produces or otherwise operates about them it is called the WILL. Hence there can be no idea formed of a soul or spirit; for all ideas whatever, being passive and inert (vide sect. 25), they cannot represent unto us, by way of image or LIKENESS, that which acts. A little attention will make it plain to any one, that to have an idea which shall be like that active principle of motion and change of ideas is absolutely impossible. Such is the nature of SPIRIT, or that which acts, that it cannot be of itself perceived, BUT ONLY BY THE EFFECTS WHICH IT PRODUCETH. If any man shall doubt of the truth of what is here delivered, let him but reflect and try if he can frame the idea of any power or active being, and whether he has ideas of two principal powers, marked by the names WILL and UNDERSTANDING, distinct from each other as well as from a third idea of Substance or Being in general, with a relative notion of its supporting or being the subject of the aforesaid powers--which is signified by the name SOUL or SPIRIT. This is what some hold; but, so far as I can see, the words WILL [Note: ""Understanding, mind.""--Edit 1710.], SOUL, SPIRIT, do not stand for different ideas, or, in truth, for any idea at all, but for something which is very different from ideas, and which, being an agent, cannot be like unto, or represented by, any idea whatsoever. Though it must be owned at the same time that we have some notion of soul, spirit, and the operations of the mind: such as willing, loving, hating--inasmuch as we know or understand the meaning of these words.
28. I find I can excite ideas in my mind at pleasure, and vary and shift the scene as oft as I think fit. It is no more than willing, and straightway this or that idea arises in my fancy; and by the same power it is obliterated and makes way for another. This making and unmaking of ideas doth very properly denominate the mind active. Thus much is certain and grounded on experience; but when we think of unthinking agents or of exciting ideas exclusive of volition, we only amuse ourselves with words.
29. IDEAS OF SENSATION DIFFER FROM THOSE OF REFLECTION OR MEMORY.--But, whatever power I may have over MY OWN thoughts, I find the ideas actually perceived by Sense have not a like dependence on my will. When in broad daylight I open my eyes, it is not in my power to choose whether I shall see or no, or to determine what particular objects shall present themselves to my view; and so likewise as to the hearing and other senses; the ideas imprinted on them are not creatures of my will. There is THEREFORE SOME OTHER WILL OR SPIRIT that PRODUCES THEM.
30. LAWS OF NATURE.--The ideas of Sense are more strong, lively, and DISTINCT than those of the imagination; they have likewise a steadiness, order, and coherence, and are not excited at random, as those which are the effects of human wills often are, but in a regular train or series, the admirable connexion whereof sufficiently testifies the wisdom and benevolence of its Author. Now THE SET RULES OR ESTABLISHED METHODS WHEREIN THE MIND WE DEPEND ON EXCITES IN US THE IDEAS OF SENSE, ARE CALLED THE LAWS OF NATURE; and these we learn by experience, which teaches us that such and such ideas are attended with such and such other ideas, in the ordinary course of things.","从混沌初开，阴阳二气在那无际的时空中交织变幻，宇宙万物由此诞生。阴阳二气，互为根本，互为依托，交合互动而产生万事万物之理。这种宏大而精妙的生成过程，不仅揭示了天地自然的奥秘，也展现了人与天地自然紧密联系的真相。自古以来，哲人圣贤无不赞叹于此，与天人合一的思想深植于古老的智慧之中。正如古语所云，‘天人合一’，人的精神源自苍穹之上，而形骸则根植于大地之中。通过人与天地自然的这份深远关系，我们得以窥见宇宙内在的和谐运转与人类自身的微妙联系。

精神与形体的内在联系在万物之中显得尤为显著。精神者，无形而有质，如同天空般无边无际；形体者，有形而有需，如大地，厚重实在。精神如清风明月，无所不在，却又不可捉摸；形体如山川河流，形态各异，却实实在在地存在于天地之间。精神与形体，共鸣共振，在阴阳流转中生生不息。精神为形体之主，形体为精神之器。精神安宁，形体则康健；精神动荡，形体则疾苦。自古以来的养生之道，无不强调精神的内守与形体的调养，二者缺一不可。

然而，在这纷繁复杂的世间，人们常常陷入追求身外之物的泥淖之中而难以自拔。名利、权势、财富，这些浮华的外在之物，极易蒙蔽人心，使人迷失于物欲的沼泽中。然而，追逐这些外物，便如同饮鸩止渴，只会使人的精神愈加凋敝，形骸愈加虚弱。浮华外物的诱惑，常使人心志蒙尘，五脏不宁，体内的气血失调，难免为各种疾病所侵袭。故圣贤告诫我们，勿以物欲惑心，须保持内心精神的澄澈清明。

保持精神内守，乃是安身立命之本。精神内守，则心志清明，五脏安和，气血调顺，身体康健。保持精神内守，意即敬畏自然，顺应天道，无欲无求，心无挂碍。人心如镜，纤尘不染，则照闲揽明。精神内守的人，远离喧嚣，内心安宁，能以平和之心，观照世间万象。

欲望如洪水猛兽，若不加以节制，将会吞噬我们的精神与健康。嗜欲过度，情感汹涌，皆是扰乱心志，耗散精气之源。情感是人之为人的自然属性，但若纵情任欲，情感过剩，则犹如野火燎原，不仅损耗精神，更会伤害形体。嗜欲过度，亦如大旱之年，河流干涸，地下水源亦难逃枯竭。适度节制嗜欲，适度调和情感，是养精神、护形体的智慧之道。

古人云，‘道法自然’，乃提醒我们顺应自然之道，保持心境的澄明静谧。精神内守与恬静，在现代世界中尤为重要。人们忙于追逐名利，心中装满了焦虑与欲望，忘却了内心真正的宁静和安详。内守精神，不为外物所扰，把持一种平和沉静的心态，是现代生活中寻求自我宁静的一帖良方。

最终，我们应铭记人之所以为人，不仅在于形体，也在于精神。只有当精神与形体和谐统一，才能获得真正的健康与幸福。保持精神内守，避免过度的嗜欲与情感的波动，是我们应当遵循的人生智慧。精神与形体的和谐美，是我们每一个人在繁杂世界中获得安宁与幸福的关键。",易,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage argues against the existence of material substance, stating that all perceived objects and ideas exist solely within the mind. The author challenges readers to conceive of any material object existing without being perceived, which he deems impossible and a contradiction. Furthermore, he refutes the notion of inanimate objects having power or agency, asserting instead that a spirit or mind is the cause of ideas and sensations. The argument dismantles the idea of unthinking substances existing independently, stating that such concepts are meaningless. The text concludes that while we can manipulate ideas within our own minds, sensory experiences occur independently of our will, thus indicating the presence of another will or spirit behind them. The established patterns by which we perceive sensory ideas are termed 'laws of nature,' showcasing the order and wisdom of a higher mind responsible for our sensory experiences.",1694

When in broad daylight I open my eyes, it is not in my power to choose whether I shall see or no, or to determine what particular objects shall present themselves to my view; and so likewise as to the hearing and other senses; the ideas imprinted on them are not creatures of my will. There is THEREFORE SOME OTHER WILL OR SPIRIT that PRODUCES THEM.
31. LAWS OF NATURE.--The ideas of Sense are more strong, lively, and DISTINCT than those of the imagination; they have likewise a steadiness, order, and coherence, and are not excited at random, as those which are the effects of human wills often are, but in a regular train or series, the admirable connexion whereof sufficiently testifies the wisdom and benevolence of its Author. Now THE SET RULES OR ESTABLISHED METHODS WHEREIN THE MIND WE DEPEND ON EXCITES IN US THE IDEAS OF SENSE, ARE CALLED THE LAWS OF NATURE; and these we learn by experience, which teaches us that such and such ideas are attended with such and such other ideas, in the ordinary course of things.",,,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage argues against the existence of material substance, stating that all perceived objects and ideas exist solely within the mind. The author challenges readers to conceive of any material object existing without being perceived, which he deems impossible and a contradiction. Furthermore, he refutes the notion of inanimate objects having power or agency, asserting instead that a spirit or mind is the cause of ideas and sensations. The argument dismantles the idea of unthinking substances existing independently, stating that such concepts are meaningless. The text concludes that while we can manipulate ideas within our own minds, sensory experiences occur independently of our will, thus indicating the presence of another will or spirit behind them. The established patterns by which we perceive sensory ideas are termed 'laws of nature,' showcasing the order and wisdom of a higher mind responsible for our sensory experiences.",1694
"21. Were it necessary to add any FURTHER PROOF AGAINST THE EXISTENCE OF MATTER after what has been said, I could instance several of those errors and difficulties (not to mention impieties) which have sprung from that tenet. It has occasioned numberless controversies and disputes in philosophy, and not a few of far greater moment in religion. But I shall not enter into the detail of them in this place, as well because I think arguments A POSTERIORI are unnecessary for confirming what has been, if I mistake not, sufficiently demonstrated A PRIORI, as because I shall hereafter find occasion to speak somewhat of them.
22. I am afraid I have given cause to think I am needlessly prolix in handling this subject. For, to what purpose is it to dilate on that which may be demonstrated with the utmost evidence in a line or two, to any one that is capable of the least reflexion? It is but looking into your own thoughts, and so trying whether you can conceive it possible for a sound, or figure, or motion, or colour to exist without the mind or unperceived. This easy trial may perhaps make you see that what you contend for is a downright contradiction. Insomuch that I am content to put the whole upon this issue:--If you can but CONCEIVE it possible for one extended movable substance, or, in general, for any one idea, or anything like an idea, to exist otherwise than in a mind perceiving it, I shall readily give up the cause. And, as for all that COMPAGES of external bodies you contend for, I shall grant you its existence, THOUGH (1.) YOU CANNOT EITHER GIVE ME ANY REASON WHY YOU BELIEVE IT EXISTS [Vide sect. lviii.], OR (2.) ASSIGN ANY USE TO IT WHEN IT IS SUPPOSED TO EXIST [Vide sect. lx.]. I say, the bare possibility of your opinions being true shall pass for an argument that it is so. [Note: i.e. although your argument be deficient in the two requisites of an hypothesis.--Ed.]
23. But, say you, surely there is nothing easier than for me to imagine trees, for instance, in a park, or books existing in a closet, and nobody by to perceive them. I answer, you may so, there is no difficulty in it; but what is all this, I beseech you, more than framing in your mind certain ideas which you call BOOKS and TREES, and the same time omitting to frame the idea of any one that may perceive them? BUT DO NOT YOU YOURSELF PERCEIVE OR THINK OF THEM ALL THE WHILE? This therefore is nothing to the purpose; it only shows you have the power of imagining or forming ideas in your mind: but it does not show that you can conceive it possible the objects of your thought may exist without the mind. To make out this, IT IS NECESSARY THAT YOU CONCEIVE THEM EXISTING UNCONCEIVED OR UNTHOUGHT OF, WHICH IS A MANIFEST REPUGNANCY. When we do our utmost to conceive the existence of external bodies, we are all the while only contemplating our own ideas. But the mind taking no notice of itself, is deluded to think it can and does conceive bodies existing unthought of or without the mind, though at the same time they are apprehended by or exist in itself. A little attention will discover to any one the truth and evidence of what is here said, and make it unnecessary to insist on any other proofs against the existence of material substance.
24. THE ABSOLUTE EXISTENCE OF UNTHINKING THINGS ARE WORDS WITHOUT A MEANING.--It is very obvious, upon the least inquiry into our thoughts, to know whether it is possible for us to understand what is meant by the ABSOLUTE EXISTENCE OF SENSIBLE OBJECTS IN THEMSELVES, OR WITHOUT THE MIND. To me it is evident those words mark out either a direct contradiction, or else nothing at all. And to convince others of this, I know no readier or fairer way than to entreat they would calmly attend to their own thoughts; and if by this attention the emptiness or repugnancy of those expressions does appear, surely nothing more is requisite for the conviction. It is on this therefore that I insist, to wit, that the ABSOLUTE existence of unthinking things are words without a meaning, or which include a contradiction. This is what I repeat and inculcate, and earnestly recommend to the attentive thoughts of the reader.
25. THIRD ARGUMENT.[Note: Vide sect. iii. and vii.]--REFUTATION OF LOCKE.--All our ideas, sensations, notions, or the things which we perceive, by whatsoever names they may be distinguished, are visibly inactive--there is nothing of power or agency included in them. So that ONE IDEA or object of thought CANNOT PRODUCE or make ANY ALTERATION IN ANOTHER. To be satisfied of the truth of this, there is nothing else requisite but a bare observation of our ideas. For, since they and every part of them exist only in the mind, it follows that there is nothing in them but what is perceived: but whoever shall attend to his ideas, whether of sense or reflexion, will not perceive in them any power or activity; there is, therefore, no such thing contained in them. A little attention will discover to us that the very being of an idea implies passiveness and inertness in it, insomuch that it is impossible for an idea to do anything, or, strictly speaking, to be the cause of anything: neither can it be the resemblance or pattern of any active being, as is evident from sect. 8. Whence it plainly follows that extension, figure, and motion cannot be the cause of our sensations. To say, therefore, that these are the effects of powers resulting from the configuration, number, motion, and size of corpuscles, must certainly be false. [Note: Vide sect. cii.]
26. CAUSE OF IDEAS.--We perceive a continual succession of ideas, some are anew excited, others are changed or totally disappear. There is therefore some cause of these ideas, whereon they depend, and which produces and changes them. That this cause cannot be any quality or idea or combination of ideas, is clear from the preceding section. It must therefore be a substance; but it has been shown that there is no corporeal or material substance: it remains therefore that the CAUSE OF IDEAS is an incorporeal active substance or Spirit.
27. NO IDEA OF SPIRIT.--A spirit is one simple, undivided, active being--as it perceives ideas it is called the UNDERSTANDING, and as it produces or otherwise operates about them it is called the WILL. Hence there can be no idea formed of a soul or spirit; for all ideas whatever, being passive and inert (vide sect. 25), they cannot represent unto us, by way of image or LIKENESS, that which acts. A little attention will make it plain to any one, that to have an idea which shall be like that active principle of motion and change of ideas is absolutely impossible. Such is the nature of SPIRIT, or that which acts, that it cannot be of itself perceived, BUT ONLY BY THE EFFECTS WHICH IT PRODUCETH. If any man shall doubt of the truth of what is here delivered, let him but reflect and try if he can frame the idea of any power or active being, and whether he has ideas of two principal powers, marked by the names WILL and UNDERSTANDING, distinct from each other as well as from a third idea of Substance or Being in general, with a relative notion of its supporting or being the subject of the aforesaid powers--which is signified by the name SOUL or SPIRIT. This is what some hold; but, so far as I can see, the words WILL [Note: ""Understanding, mind.""--Edit 1710.], SOUL, SPIRIT, do not stand for different ideas, or, in truth, for any idea at all, but for something which is very different from ideas, and which, being an agent, cannot be like unto, or represented by, any idea whatsoever. Though it must be owned at the same time that we have some notion of soul, spirit, and the operations of the mind: such as willing, loving, hating--inasmuch as we know or understand the meaning of these words.
28. I find I can excite ideas in my mind at pleasure, and vary and shift the scene as oft as I think fit. It is no more than willing, and straightway this or that idea arises in my fancy; and by the same power it is obliterated and makes way for another. This making and unmaking of ideas doth very properly denominate the mind active. Thus much is certain and grounded on experience; but when we think of unthinking agents or of exciting ideas exclusive of volition, we only amuse ourselves with words.
29. IDEAS OF SENSATION DIFFER FROM THOSE OF REFLECTION OR MEMORY.--But, whatever power I may have over MY OWN thoughts, I find the ideas actually perceived by Sense have not a like dependence on my will. When in broad daylight I open my eyes, it is not in my power to choose whether I shall see or no, or to determine what particular objects shall present themselves to my view; and so likewise as to the hearing and other senses; the ideas imprinted on them are not creatures of my will. There is THEREFORE SOME OTHER WILL OR SPIRIT that PRODUCES THEM.
32. LAWS OF NATURE.--The ideas of Sense are more strong, lively, and DISTINCT than those of the imagination; they have likewise a steadiness, order, and coherence, and are not excited at random, as those which are the effects of human wills often are, but in a regular train or series, the admirable connexion whereof sufficiently testifies the wisdom and benevolence of its Author.

"The idea of an object is an essential part of the belief of it, but not the whole. We conceive many things, which we do not believe. In order then to discover more fully the nature of belief, or the qualities of those ideas we assent to, let us weigh the following considerations.
It is evident, that all reasonings from causes or effects terminate in conclusions, concerning matter of fact; that is, concerning the existence of objects or of their qualities. It is also evident, that the idea, of existence is nothing different from the idea of any object, and that when after the simple conception of any thing we would conceive it as existent, we in reality make no addition to or alteration on our first idea. Thus when we affirm, that God is existent, we simply form the idea of such a being, as he is represented to us; nor is the existence, which we attribute to him, conceived by a particular idea, which we join to the idea of his other qualities, and can again separate and distinguish from them. But I go farther; and not content with asserting, that the conception of the existence of any object is no addition to the simple conception of it, I likewise maintain, that the belief of the existence joins no new ideas to those which compose the idea of the object. When I think of God, when I think of him as existent, and when I believe him to be existent, my idea of him neither encreases nor diminishes. But as it is certain there is a great difference betwixt the simple conception of the existence of an object, and the belief of it, and as this difference lies not in the parts or composition of the idea, which we conceive; it follows, that it must lie in the manner, in which we conceive it.
Suppose a person present with me, who advances propositions, to which I do not assent, that Caesar dyed in his bed, that silver is more fusible, than lead, or mercury heavier than gold; it is evident, that notwithstanding my incredulity, I clearly understand his meaning, and form all the same ideas, which he forms. My imagination is endowed with the same powers as his; nor is it possible for him to conceive any idea, which I cannot conceive; nor conjoin any, which I cannot conjoin. I therefore ask, Wherein consists the difference betwixt believing and disbelieving any proposition? The answer is easy with regard to propositions, that are proved by intuition or demonstration. In that case, the person, who assents, not only conceives the ideas according to the proposition, but is necessarily determined to conceive them in that particular manner, either immediately or by the interposition of other ideas. Whatever is absurd is unintelligible; nor is it possible for the imagination to conceive any thing contrary to a demonstration. But as in reasonings from causation, and concerning matters of fact, this absolute necessity cannot take place, and the imagination is free to conceive both sides of the question, I still ask, Wherein consists the deference betwixt incredulity and belief? since in both cases the conception of the idea is equally possible and requisite.
It will not be a satisfactory answer to say, that a person, who does not assent to a proposition you advance; after having conceived the object in the same manner with you; immediately conceives it in a different manner, and has different ideas of it. This answer is unsatisfactory; not because it contains any falshood, but because it discovers not all the truth. It is contest, that in all cases, wherein we dissent from any person, we conceive both sides of the question; but as we can believe only one, it evidently follows, that the belief must make some difference betwixt that conception to which we assent, and that from which we dissent. We may mingle, and unite, and separate, and confound, and vary our ideas in a hundred different ways; but until there appears some principle, which fixes one of these different situations, we have in reality no opinion: And this principle, as it plainly makes no addition to our precedent ideas, can only change the manner of our conceiving them.
All the perceptions of the mind are of two kinds, viz. impressions and ideas, which differ from each other only in their different degrees of force and vivacity. Our ideas are copyed from our impressions, and represent them in all their parts. When you would any way vary the idea of a particular object, you can only encrease or diminish its force and vivacity. If you make any other change on it, it represents a different object or impression. The case is the same as in colours. A particular shade of any colour may acquire a new degree of liveliness or brightness without any other variation. But when you produce any other variation, it is no longer the same shade or colour. So that as belief does nothing but vary the manner, in which we conceive any object, it can only bestow on our ideas an additional force and vivacity. An opinion, therefore, or belief may be most accurately defined, a lively idea related to or associated with a present impression.[6]
","自古以来，宇宙的起源一直是哲学家和思想家们深思的话题。在古老的传说和哲学体系中，宇宙从混沌状态中诞生，阴阳二气相互作用，进而产生万物，这一过程揭示了天地自然与人类的深刻联系。本文将从宇宙的起源、人类的精神与形体的关系、精神内守的重要性，以及如何保持身心健康等方面进行探讨。

宇宙从混沌状态中诞生，意味着原本的无序状态中蕴含着无限的可能性。阴阳二气作为两种相互对立但又密不可分的力量，它们的交融演化，造就了宇宙万物。阴与阳不仅仅是两种物质或能量，更代表着宇宙中的两种基本属性，即对立统一的辩证关系。阴阳相生相克，变化无常，正是在这种动态中，生命得以存在发展。

在天地之间，人类作为宇宙的一部分，其精神源自上天，形骸源自大地。这种哲学思想揭示了人作为自然的一员，既受天的影响，又依赖于地。我们可以把精神看作是天赐的神圣能量，它承载着智慧与意念；而形体则是大地的馈赠，支持我们的基本生存需求。精神和身体虽有不同来源，但二者却是相辅相成，息息相关。

然而，在物质文明高度发展的今天，越来越多的人被外在的追求所左右，沉溺于物质财富、名利地位的争夺中，渐渐迷失内心。这种身外之物的追求，往往会损害我们的内在精神，犹如被欲望的洪流冲刷，心志变得混杂、迷乱，丧失了本真的清明。唯有保持精神的内守，才能使心志清明，五脏安宁，并从内而外的抵御各种灾祸的侵扰。

保持精神的内守，不仅仅是一种消极的自我关闭，它更是一种积极的自我修炼。通过深思、冥想以及对天地自然之道的体悟，我们可以与宇宙的根本力量相连通，使得自己的精神内外协调统一，从而达到一种心灵的宁静与充实。此外，气血同样是维持身体健康的重要因素。气血充盈，周流不息，是人体内在生机的体现。保持气血通畅，关键在于心境平和，情绪稳定。

嗜欲和情感的适度固然使生活丰富多彩，但过度的追求和情感泛滥，会导致精神和气血的耗散。这就如同将一杯清水搅动，原本澄澈的水变得浑浊，久而久之，精气耗散，身体也会随之衰弱。古贤常言：“养生先养心。”养心的核心在于清心寡欲，远离浮华喧嚣，保持一颗宁静的心，才能使精神内守，气血和谐。

现实生活中，如何具体实践精神的内守与气血的调和呢？首先，要培养正念和内省的习惯。每天抽出一定的时间静心冥想，反思自己的言行举止，了解真正的内心渴求。其次，保持规律的作息和饮食，适度的运动，增强体魄，使内外兼修成为习惯。再次，学会适时放下对外在物质的执着，减少不必要的精神负担，享受简单生活的宁静与美好。

此外，与天地自然保持和谐的关系也至关重要。顺应自然的节律，遵循四时变化，在春夏之交生发，在秋冬之际收藏，才能与自然的伟力相呼应。古人常说“天人合一”，“道法自然”，这些智慧体现出人类与自然的共生观念，提醒我们应当尊重和善待自身以及周围的环境。

宇宙的生成演化，阴阳之气的交融变化，生生不息的生命轮回，都在诉说着一个亘古不变的真理：内心的平和与宁静，才是使我们在这茫茫宇宙中不朽的根本。这不仅是一种深奥的哲理，更是我们每一个人日常生活中可以实践的具体方法。通过追求精神内守，保持与天地自然的和谐，我们便能在纷繁复杂的世间，找到一片属于自己的宁静天地。",易,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage discusses the nature of belief and the distinction between mere conception and belief in the existence of an object.

"There is, in Dr. Tillotson's writings, an argument against the real presence, which is as concise, and elegant, and strong as any argument can possibly be supposed against a doctrine, so little worthy of a serious refutation. It is acknowledged on all hands, says that learned prelate, that the authority, either of the scripture or of tradition, is founded merely in the testimony of the apostles, who were eye-witnesses to those miracles of our Saviour, by which he proved his divine mission. Our evidence, then, for the truth of the Christian religion is less than the evidence for the truth of our senses; because, even in the first authors of our religion, it was no greater; and it is evident it must diminish in passing from them to their disciples; nor can any one rest such confidence in their testimony, as in the immediate object of his senses. But a weaker evidence can never destroy a stronger; and therefore, were the doctrine of the real presence ever so clearly revealed in scripture, it were directly contrary to the rules of just reasoning to give our assent to it. It contradicts sense, though both the scripture and tradition, on which it is supposed to be built, carry not such evidence with them as sense; when they are considered merely as external evidences, and are not brought home to every one's breast, by the immediate operation of the Holy Spirit.
Nothing is so convenient as a decisive argument of this kind, which must at least silence the most arrogant bigotry and superstition, and free us from their impertinent solicitations. I flatter myself, that I have discovered an argument of a like nature, which, if just, will, with the wise and learned, be an everlasting check to all kinds of superstitious delusion, and consequently, will be useful as long as the world endures. For so long, I presume, will the accounts of miracles and prodigies be found in all history, sacred and profane.
87.Though experience be our only guide in reasoning concerning matters of fact; it must be acknowledged, that this guide is not altogether infallible, but in some cases is apt to lead us into errors. One, who in our climate, should expect better weather in any week of June than in one of December, would reason justly, and conformably to experience; but it is certain, that he may happen, in the event, to find himself mistaken. However, we may observe, that, in such a case, he would have no cause to complain of experience; because it commonly informs us beforehand of the uncertainty, by that contrariety of events, which we may learn from a diligent observation. All effects follow not with like certainty from their supposed causes. Some events are found, in all countries and all ages, to have been constantly conjoined together: Others are found to have been more variable, and sometimes to disappoint our expectations; so that, in our reasonings concerning matter of fact, there are all imaginable degrees of assurance, from the highest certainty to the lowest species of moral evidence.
A wise man, therefore, proportions his belief to the evidence. In such conclusions as are founded on an infallible experience, he expects the event with the last degree of assurance, and regards his past experience as a full proof of the future existence of that event. In other cases, he proceeds with more caution: He weighs the opposite experiments: He considers which side is supported by the greater number of experiments: to that side he inclines, with doubt and hesitation; and when at last he fixes his judgement, the evidence exceeds not what we properly call probability. All probability, then, supposes an opposition of experiments and observations, where the one side is found to overbalance the other, and to produce a degree of evidence, proportioned to the superiority. A hundred instances or experiments on one side, and fifty on another, afford a doubtful expectation of any event; though a hundred uniform experiments, with only one that is contradictory, reasonably beget a pretty strong degree of assurance. In all cases, we must balance the opposite experiments, where they are opposite, and deduct the smaller number from the greater, in order to know the exact force of the superior evidence.
88.To apply these principles to a particular instance; we may observe, that there is no species of reasoning more common, more useful, and even necessary to human life, than that which is derived from the testimony of men, and the reports of eye-witnesses and spectators. This species of reasoning, perhaps, one may deny to be founded on the relation of cause and effect. I shall not dispute about a word. It will be sufficient to observe that our assurance in any argument of this kind is derived from no other principle than our observation of the veracity of human testimony, and of the usual conformity of facts to the reports of witnesses. It being a general maxim, that no objects have any discoverable connexion together, and that all the inferences, which we can draw from one to another, are founded merely on our experience of their constant and regular conjunction; it is evident, that we ought not to make an exception to this maxim in favour of human testimony, whose connexion with any event seems, in itself, as little necessary as any other. Were not the memory tenacious to a certain degree, had not men commonly an inclination to truth and a principle of probity; were they not sensible to shame, when detected in a falsehood: Were not these, I say, discovered by experience to be qualities, inherent in human nature, we should never repose the least confidence in human testimony. A man delirious, or noted for falsehood and villany, has no manner of authority with us.
And as the evidence, derived from witnesses and human testimony, is founded on past experience, so it varies with the experience, and is regarded either as a proof or a probability, according as the conjunction between any particular kind of report and any kind of object has been found to be constant or variable. There are a number of circumstances to be taken into consideration in all judgements of this kind; and the ultimate standard, by which we determine all disputes, that may arise concerning them, is always derived from experience and observation. Where this experience is not entirely uniform on any side, it is attended with an unavoidable contrariety in our judgements, and with the same opposition and mutual destruction of argument as in every other kind of evidence. We frequently hesitate concerning the reports of others. We balance the opposite circumstances, which cause any doubt or uncertainty; and when we discover a superiority on any side, we incline to it; but still with a diminution of assurance, in proportion to the force of its antagonist.
89.This contrariety of evidence, in the present case, may be derived from several different causes; from the opposition of contrary testimony; from the character or number of the witnesses; from the manner of their delivering their testimony; or from the union of all these circumstances. We entertain a suspicion concerning any matter of fact, when the witnesses contradict each other; when they are but few, or of a doubtful character; when they have an interest in what they affirm; when they deliver their testimony with hesitation, or on the contrary, with too violent asseverations. There are many other particulars of the same kind, which may diminish or destroy the force of any argument, derived from human testimony.
Suppose, for instance, that the fact, which the testimony endeavours to establish, partakes of the extraordinary and the marvellous; in that case, the evidence, resulting from the testimony, admits of a diminution, greater or less, in proportion as the fact is more or less unusual. The reason why we place any credit in witnesses and historians, is not derived from any connexion, which we perceive a priori, between testimony and reality, but because we are accustomed to find a conformity between them. But when the fact attested is such a one as has seldom fallen under our observation, here is a contest of two opposite experiences; of which the one destroys the other, as far as its force goes, and the superior can only operate on the mind by the force, which remains. The very same principle of experience, which gives us a certain degree of assurance in the testimony of witnesses, gives us also, in this case, another degree of assurance against the fact, which they endeavour to establish; from which contradition there necessarily arises a counterpoize, and mutual destruction of belief and authority.","在宇宙初始之时，天地尚处于一片混沌之中。正是在这无限的混沌之中，阴阳二气逐渐分化并相互交融，形成了我们所知的万物。阴阳二气的和谐共生、交互作用，是宇宙中一切生机与变化的根源。它们不仅支配了天地万物的生成和衰亡，还在我们人类身上直接体现出来，揭示了人与天地自然密不可分的联系。

人与天地自然的关系，不仅仅停留在物质的层面上。人的精神本源于上天，而形骸则源自大地。这一内在联系揭示了精神与形体之间的深刻关系。人的精神如同来自天界的光芒，不断照耀和引导着我们的存在过程。而形体则如同大地的承载物，为精神提供了栖息之所和行动的工具。精神与形体的和谐，便是人的健康与智慧的基石。

然而，世俗生活中，人类往往被各种外在的诱惑所驱使，追求身外之物，令内心的精神逐渐蒙尘。追求财富、地位、物质的享受等外在之物，虽然可以暂时满足我们的欲望，但却会逐渐蚕食我们的精神世界。精神被外物所牵绊，便失去了其应有的清明，心志开始迷茫，五脏六腑也因此难以安宁。外在的追求虽然看似光彩夺目，却在不知不觉中侵蚀了我们的内在和平与安宁。

保持精神内守，是通向清明心志和安宁身心的关键。当我们迈出追求外物的步伐，转而将目光投向内在的世界，我们的精神将回归本源的平和与宁静。精神内守，意味着我们要时刻关注自己的内心，检视自己的情感和欲望，不让自己被外界的纷扰所动摇。内心的沉静，犹如一片无波的湖水，映照着真实的自我，不受尘世污染。在这样的状态下，我们的心志清明，五脏安宁，外界的灾祸也难以入侵。

保持精神和气血的内守与恬静，不仅是保持健康的要义，更是我们生命智慧的体现。过度的嗜欲和情感起伏，必然会导致精气的耗散。情感如同河流，有其自然的节奏与流动，过度的激荡只会使河道变得湍急，最终冲毁我们身体的堤坝。精神的消耗，既是身体的耗损，也是生命的衰退。只有保持精神的内守，才能让我们在生命的长河中平稳前行，恒久不衰。

因此，我们应当警惕嗜欲和情感的过度，避免精气耗散对健康的伤害。以静养生，以内守精神，这不仅是一种生活的哲学，更是一种智慧的选择。在纷繁的世界中，寻得一份内心的宁静，是对自我最大慈悲和关爱。站在天地之间，我们不仅是物质的存在，更是精神的桥梁。让我们以精神的宁静，连接天地，安顿自己，最终达成身心的和谐与统一。",易,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage examines the nature of evidence and belief, focusing on religious doctrines like the real presence, and the credibility of human testimony.

87.Though experience be our only guide in reasoning concerning matters of fact; it must be acknowledged, that this guide is not altogether infallible, but in some cases is apt to lead us into errors. One, who in our climate, should expect better weather in any week of June than in one of December, would reason justly, and conformably to experience; but it is certain, that he may happen, in the event, to find himself mistaken.

All effects follow not with like certainty from their supposed causes. Some events are found, in all countries and all ages, to have been constantly conjoined together: Others are found to have been more variable, and sometimes to disappoint our expectations; so that, in our reasonings concerning matter of fact, there are all imaginable degrees of assurance, from the highest certainty to the lowest species of moral evidence.

"It will be best to prepare the ground for my thesis by a few very general remarks on the method of getting at scientific truth. It is a common platitude that a complete acquaintance with any one thing, however small, would require a knowledge of the entire universe. Not a sparrow falls to the ground but some of the remote conditions of his fall are to be found in the milky way, in our federal constitution, or in the early history of Europe. That is to say, alter the milky way, alter the federal constitution, alter the facts of our barbarian ancestry, and the universe would so far be a different universe from what it now is. One fact involved in the difference might be that the particular little street-boy who threw the stone which brought down the sparrow might not find himself opposite the sparrow at that particular moment; or, finding himself there, he might not be in that particular serene and disengaged mood of mind which expressed itself in throwing the stone. But, true as all this is, it would be very foolish for any one who {217}was inquiring the cause of the sparrow's fall to overlook the boy as too personal, proximate, and so to speak anthropomorphic an agent, and to say that the true cause is the federal constitution, the westward migration of the Celtic race, or the structure of the milky way. If we proceeded on that method, we might say with perfect legitimacy that a friend of ours, who had slipped on the ice upon his door-step and cracked his skull, some months after dining with thirteen at the table, died because of that ominous feast. I know, in fact, one such instance; and I might, if I chose, contend with perfect logical propriety that the slip on the ice was no real accident. ""There are no accidents,"" I might say, ""for science. The whole history of the world converged to produce that slip. If anything had been left out, the slip would not have occurred just there and then. To say it would is to deny the relations of cause and effect throughout the universe. The real cause of the death was not the slip, but the conditions which engendered the slip,—and among them his having sat at a table, six months previous, one among thirteen. That is truly the reason why he died within the year.""
It will soon be seen whose arguments I am, in form, reproducing here. I would fain lay down the truth without polemics or recrimination. But unfortunately we never fully grasp the import of any true statement until we have a clear notion of what the opposite untrue statement would be. The error is needed to set off the truth, much as a dark background is required for exhibiting the brightness of a picture. And the error which I am going to use as a foil to set off what seems to me the truth of my own statements is contained in the philosophy of Mr. Herbert Spencer and {218}his disciples. Our problem is, What are the causes that make communities change from generation to generation,—that make the England of Queen Anne so different from the England of Elizabeth, the Harvard College of to-day so different from that of thirty years ago?
I shall reply to this problem, The difference is due to the accumulated influences of individuals, of their examples, their initiatives, and their decisions. The Spencerian school replies, The changes are irrespective of persons, and independent of individual control. They are due to the environment, to the circumstances, the physical geography, the ancestral conditions, the increasing experience of outer relations; to everything, in fact, except the Grants and the Bismarcks, the Joneses and the Smiths.

Now, I say that these theorizers are guilty of precisely the same fallacy as he who should ascribe the death of his friend to the dinner with thirteen, or the fall of the sparrow to the milky way. Like the dog in the fable, who drops his real bone to snatch at its image, they drop the real causes to snatch at others, which from no possible human point of view are available or attainable. Their fallacy is a practical one. Let us see where it lies. Although I believe in free-will myself, I will waive that belief in this discussion, and assume with the Spencerians the predestination of all human actions. On that assumption I gladly allow that were the intelligence investigating the man's or the sparrow's death omniscient and omnipresent, able to take in the whole of time and space at a single glance, there would not be the slightest objection to the milky way or the fatal feast being {219}invoked among the sought-for causes. Such a divine intelligence would see instantaneously all the infinite lines of convergence towards a given result, and it would, moreover, see impartially: it would see the fatal feast to be as much a condition of the sparrow's death as of the man's; it would see the boy with the stone to be as much a condition of the man's fall as of the sparrow's.
The human mind, however, is constituted on an entirely different plan. It has no such power of universal intuition. Its finiteness obliges it to see but two or three things at a time. If it wishes to take wider sweeps it has to use 'general ideas,' as they are called, and in so doing to drop all concrete truths. Thus, in the present case, if we as men wish to feel the connection between the milky way and the boy and the dinner and the sparrow and the man's death, we can do so only by falling back on the enormous emptiness of what is called an abstract proposition. We must say, All things in the world are fatally predetermined, and hang together in the adamantine fixity of a system of natural law. But in the vagueness of this vast proposition we have lost all the concrete facts and links; and in all practical matters the concrete links are the only things of importance. The human mind is essentially partial. It can be efficient at all only by picking out what to attend to, and ignoring everything else,—by narrowing its point of view. Otherwise, what little strength it has is dispersed, and it loses its way altogether. Man always wants his curiosity gratified for a particular purpose. If, in the case of the sparrow, the purpose is punishment, it would be idiotic to wander off from the cats, boys, and other possible agencies close by in the street, to {220}survey the early Celts and the milky way: the boy would meanwhile escape. And if, in the case of the unfortunate man, we lose ourselves in contemplation of the thirteen-at-table mystery, and fail to notice the ice on the step and cover it with ashes, some other poor fellow, who never dined out in his life, may slip on it in coming to the door, and fall and break his head too.
It is, then, a necessity laid upon us as human beings to limit our view. In mathematics we know how this method of ignoring and neglecting quantities lying outside of a certain range has been adopted in the differential calculus. The calculator throws out all the 'infinitesimals' of the quantities he is considering. He treats them (under certain rules) as if they did not exist. In themselves they exist perfectly all the while; but they are as if they did not exist for the purposes of his calculation. Just so an astronomer, in dealing with the tidal movements of the ocean, takes no account of the waves made by the wind, or by the pressure of all the steamers which day and night are moving their thousands of tons upon its surface. Just so the marksman, in sighting his rifle, allows for the motion of the wind, but not for the equally real motion of the earth and solar system. Just so a business man's punctuality may overlook an error of five minutes, while a physicist, measuring the velocity of light, must count each thousandth of a second.
There are, in short, different cycles of operation in nature; different departments, so to speak, relatively independent of one another, so that what goes on at any moment in one may be compatible with almost any condition of things at the same time in the next. The mould on the biscuit in the store-room of a {221}man-of-war vegetates in absolute indifference to the nationality of the flag, the direction of the voyage, the weather, and the human dramas that may go on on board; and a mycologist may study it in complete abstraction from all these larger details. Only by so studying it, in fact, is there any chance of the mental concentration by which alone he may hope to learn something of its nature. On the other hand, the captain who in manoeuvring the vessel through a naval fight should think it necessary to bring the mouldy biscuit into his calculations would very likely lose the battle by reason of the excessive 'thoroughness' of his mind.
The causes which operate in these incommensurable cycles are connected with one another only if we take the whole universe into account. For all lesser points of view it is lawful—nay, more, it is for human wisdom necessary—to regard them as disconnected and irrelevant to one another.
",宇宙的诞生可以追溯到最初的混沌状态。在那不可名状的混沌之中，阴阳二气相互作用，演化出万物的生生不息。阴阳作为宇宙的基本道理，内蕴着天地自然的无穷奥秘。阴阳之气，有如宇宙的呼吸，通过无穷的运动和变化，创造出绚丽多姿的世界。阴阳的起伏运动，不仅塑造了自然界的形态，也深刻影响着人类的命运和精神世界。在天地自然面前，人类显得如此渺小，却又如此伟大。人作为天地间的产物，与天地自然有着深切的联系。人之精神源于天，形骸源于地。天授之精神，为人类带来智慧和灵光，而地孕之形骸，则是人类的庇护所与依靠。精神与形骸的结合，造就了完整的人类。精神是形骸的灯塔，指引着我们内心的方向；形骸则是精神的载体，使我们的生命得以体验。这种内在联系，揭示了人与自然的共生共荣，更昭示了宇宙的和谐与共存。精神与形骸的关系不仅限于外在的连接，更深远地影响到我们的内在世界。如果我们执迷于追求身外之物，往往会忽视内心的精神世界。物质的富足，常常带来虚荣与欲望，使我们的内心变得浮躁和不安。然而，真正的幸福并非源于外在的物质，而是源于内心的宁静与满足。因此，保持精神的内守尤为重要。内守之道，是让心志清明，五脏安宁的方法。通过内守，我们可以避免外界诱惑和困扰，使内心回归宁静。清明的心志，带来明智的判断和纯净的情感；安宁的五脏，则赋予我们健康的身体和强健的气血。精神的内守，不仅是内心的修养，也是对身体的保护。保持精神和气血的内守与恬静，能够使人远离灾祸和病患。我们的精神，如同一座灯塔，只有在宁静的状态下，才能发出最明亮的光芒。正如古人所言，恬淡虚无，真气从之，精神内守，病安从来。恬淡虚无，是抛弃杂念，心神恬静的状态；真气从之，则是身体的气血随之调和。精神内守，则是内心的智慧和灵感的源泉。在现代社会中，追求物质财富和外在成就成为普遍现象。然而，这种追求往往伴随着无尽的欲望和情感的波动。欲望的不满足，带来情感的起伏和精神的耗散。殊不知，嗜欲和情感的过度，会导致精气的耗散，进而损害我们的身心健康。我们应当学会克制欲望，保持内心的平和与宁静。精神的内守，让我们的心灵更接近自然的本真。通过内守，我们能够感受到宇宙的和谐，人与自然的呼应。精神的内守，不仅是对自己内心的宁静和满足，更是对天地自然的敬畏和顺应。我们追求的不应仅仅是外在的成就，更应注重内心的成长和智慧的提升。在阴阳和谐的宇宙中，精神的内守，让我们找到回归自然的道路。让我们在混沌中，追寻那一丝宁静与和谐，与天地自然共鸣，走向内心的清明与安宁。,易,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage discusses the method of understanding scientific truth, emphasizing the need to focus on proximate causes rather than distant or abstract ones.

"It will be best to prepare the ground for my thesis by a few very general remarks on the method of getting at scientific truth. It is a common platitude that a complete acquaintance with any one thing, however small, would require a knowledge of the entire universe. Not a sparrow falls to the ground but some of the remote conditions of his fall are to be found in the milky way, in our federal constitution, or in the early history of Europe. That is to say, alter the milky way, alter the federal constitution, alter the facts of our barbarian ancestry, and the universe would so far be a different universe from what it now is. One fact involved in the difference might be that the particular little street-boy who threw the stone which brought down the sparrow might not find himself opposite the sparrow at that particular moment; or, finding himself there, he might not be in that particular serene and disengaged mood of mind which expressed itself in throwing the stone. But, true as all this is, it would be very foolish for any one who {217}was inquiring the cause of the sparrow's fall to overlook the boy as too personal, proximate, and so to speak anthropomorphic an agent, and to say that the true cause is the federal constitution, the westward migration of the Celtic race, or the structure of the milky way. If we proceeded on that method, we might say with perfect legitimacy that a friend of ours, who had slipped on the ice upon his door-step and cracked his skull, some months after dining with thirteen at the table, died because of that ominous feast. I know, in fact, one such instance; and I might, if I chose, contend with perfect logical propriety that the slip on the ice was no real accident. ""There are no accidents,"" I might say, ""for science. The whole history of the world converged to produce that slip. If anything had been left out, the slip would not have occurred just there and then. To say it would is to deny the relations of cause and effect throughout the universe. The real cause of the death was not the slip, but the conditions which engendered the slip,—and among them his having sat at a table, six months previous, one among thirteen. That is truly the reason why he died within the year.""
It will soon be seen whose arguments I am, in form, reproducing here. I would fain lay down the truth without polemics or recrimination. But unfortunately we never fully grasp the import of any true statement until we have a clear notion of what the opposite untrue statement would be. The error is needed to set off the truth, much as a dark background is required for exhibiting the brightness of a picture. And the error which I am going to use as a foil to set off what seems to me the truth of my own statements is contained in the philosophy of Mr. Herbert Spencer and {218}his disciples. Our problem is, What are the causes that make communities change from generation to generation,—that make the England of Queen Anne so different from the England of Elizabeth, the Harvard College of to-day so different from that of thirty years ago?
I shall reply to this problem, The difference is due to the accumulated influences of individuals, of their examples, their initiatives, and their decisions. The Spencerian school replies, The changes are irrespective of persons, and independent of individual control. They are due to the environment, to the circumstances, the physical geography, the ancestral conditions, the increasing experience of outer relations; to everything, in fact, except the Grants and the Bismarcks, the Joneses and the Smiths.

Now, I say that these theorizers are guilty of precisely the same fallacy as he who should ascribe the death of his friend to the dinner with thirteen, or the fall of the sparrow to the milky way. Like the dog in the fable, who drops his real bone to snatch at its image, they drop the real causes to snatch at others, which from no possible human point of view are available or attainable. Their fallacy is a practical one. Let us see where it lies. Although I believe in free-will myself, I will waive that belief in this discussion, and assume with the Spencerians the predestination of all human actions. On that assumption I gladly allow that were the intelligence investigating the man's or the sparrow's death omniscient and omnipresent, able to take in the whole of time and space at a single glance, there would not be the slightest objection to the milky way or the fatal feast being {219}invoked among the sought-for causes. Such a divine intelligence would see instantaneously all the infinite lines of convergence towards a given result, and it would, moreover, see impartially: it would see the fatal feast to be as much a condition of the sparrow's death as of the man's; it would see the boy with the stone to be as much a condition of the man's fall as of the sparrow's.
The human mind, however, is constituted on an entirely different plan. It has no such power of universal intuition. Its finiteness obliges it to see but two or three things at a time. If it wishes to take wider sweeps it has to use 'general ideas,' as they are called, and in so doing to drop all concrete truths. Thus, in the present case, if we as men wish to feel the connection between the milky way and the boy and the dinner and the sparrow and the man's death, we can do so only by falling back on the enormous emptiness of what is called an abstract proposition. We must say, All things in the world are fatally predetermined, and hang together in the adamantine fixity of a system of natural law. But in the vagueness of this vast proposition we have lost all the concrete facts and links; and in all practical matters the concrete links are the only things of importance. The human mind is essentially partial. It can be efficient at all only by picking out what to attend to, and ignoring everything else,—by narrowing its point of view. Otherwise, what little strength it has is dispersed, and it loses its way altogether. Man always wants his curiosity gratified for a particular purpose. If, in the case of the sparrow, the purpose is punishment, it would be idiotic to wander off from the cats, boys, and other possible agencies close by in the street, to {220}survey the early Celts and the milky way: the boy would meanwhile escape. And if, in the case of the unfortunate man, we lose ourselves in contemplation of the thirteen-at-table mystery, and fail to notice the ice on the step and cover it with ashes, some other poor fellow, who never dined out in his life, may slip on it in coming to the door, and fall and break his head too.
It is, then, a necessity laid upon us as human beings to limit our view. In mathematics we know how this method of ignoring and neglecting quantities lying outside of a certain range has been adopted in the differential calculus. The calculator throws out all the 'infinitesimals' of the quantities he is considering. He treats them (under certain rules) as if they did not exist. In themselves they exist perfectly all the while; but they are as if they did not exist for the purposes of his calculation. Just so an astronomer, in dealing with the tidal movements of the ocean, takes no account of the waves made by the wind, or by the pressure of all the steamers which day and night are moving their thousands of tons upon its surface. Just so the marksman, in sighting his rifle, allows for the motion of the wind, but not for the equally real motion of the earth and solar system. Just so a business man's punctuality may overlook an error of five minutes, while a physicist, measuring the velocity of light, must count each thousandth of a second.
There are, in short, different cycles of operation in nature; different departments, so to speak, relatively independent of one another, so that what goes on at any moment in one may be compatible with almost any condition of things at the same time in the next. The mould on the biscuit in the store-room of a {222}man-of-war vegetates in absolute indifference to the nationality of the flag, the direction of the voyage, the weather, and the human dramas that may go on on board; and a mycologist may study it in complete abstraction from all these larger details. Only by so studying it, in fact, is there any chance of the mental concentration by which alone he may hope to learn something of its nature. On the other hand, the captain who in manoeuvring the vessel through a naval fight should think it necessary to bring the mouldy biscuit into his calculations would very likely lose the battle by reason of the excessive 'thoroughness' of his mind.

"As the roaring of the waves precedes the tempest, so the murmur of rising passions announces this tumultuous change; a suppressed excitement warns us of the approaching danger. A change of temper, frequent outbreaks of anger, a perpetual stirring of the mind, make the child almost ungovernable. He becomes deaf to the voice he used to obey; he is a lion in a fever; he distrusts his keeper and refuses to be controlled.
With the moral symptoms of a changing temper there are perceptible changes in appearance. His countenance develops and takes the stamp of his character; the soft and sparse down upon his cheeks becomes darker and stiffer. His voice grows hoarse or rather he loses it altogether. He is neither a child nor a man and cannot speak like either of them. His eyes, those organs of the soul which till now were dumb, find speech and meaning; a kindling fire illumines them, there is still a sacred innocence in their ever brightening glance, but they have lost their first meaningless expression; he is already aware that they can say too much; he is beginning to learn to lower his eyes and blush, he is becoming sensitive, though he does not know what it is that he feels; he is uneasy without knowing why. All this may happen gradually and give you time enough; but if his keenness becomes impatience, his eagerness madness, if he is angry and sorry all in a moment, if he weeps without cause, if in the presence of objects which are beginning to be a source of danger his pulse quickens and his eyes sparkle, if he trembles when a woman’s hand touches his, if he is troubled or timid in her presence, O Ulysses, wise Ulysses! have a care! The passages you closed with so much pains are open; the winds are unloosed; keep your hand upon the helm or all is lost.
This is the second birth I spoke of; then it is that man really enters upon life; henceforth no human passion is a stranger to him. Our efforts so far have been child’s play, now they are of the greatest importance. This period when education is usually finished is just the time to begin; but to explain this new plan properly, let us take up our story where we left it.
Our passions are the chief means of self-preservation; to try to destroy them is therefore as absurd as it is useless; this would be to overcome nature, to reshape God’s handiwork. If God bade man annihilate the passions he has given him, God would bid him be and not be; He would contradict himself. He has never given such a foolish commandment, there is nothing like it written on the heart of man, and what God will have a man do, He does not leave to the words of another man. He speaks Himself; His words are written in the secret heart.
Now I consider those who would prevent the birth of the passions almost as foolish as those who would destroy them, and those who think this has been my object hitherto are greatly mistaken.
But should we reason rightly, if from the fact that passions are natural to man, we inferred that all the passions we feel in ourselves and behold in others are natural? Their source, indeed, is natural; but they have been swollen by a thousand other streams; they are a great river which is constantly growing, one in which we can scarcely find a single drop of the original stream. Our natural passions are few in number; they are the means to freedom, they tend to self-preservation. All those which enslave and destroy us have another source; nature does not bestow them on us; we seize on them in her despite.
The origin of our passions, the root and spring of all the rest, the only one which is born with man, which never leaves him as long as he lives, is self-love; this passion is primitive, instinctive, it precedes all the rest, which are in a sense only modifications of it. In this sense, if you like, they are all natural. But most of these modifications are the result of external influences, without which they would never occur, and such modifications, far from being advantageous to us, are harmful. They change the original purpose and work against its end; then it is that man finds himself outside nature and at strife with himself.
Self-love is always good, always in accordance with the order of nature. The preservation of our own life is specially entrusted to each one of us, and our first care is, and must be, to watch over our own life; and how can we continually watch over it, if we do not take the greatest interest in it?
Self-preservation requires, therefore, that we shall love ourselves; we must love ourselves above everything, and it follows directly from this that we love what contributes to our preservation. Every child becomes fond of its nurse; Romulus must have loved the she-wolf who suckled him. At first this attachment is quite unconscious; the individual is attracted to that which contributes to his welfare and repelled by that which is harmful; this is merely blind instinct. What transforms this instinct into feeling, the liking into love, the aversion into hatred, is the evident intention of helping or hurting us. We do not become passionately attached to objects without feeling, which only follow the direction given them; but those from which we expect benefit or injury from their internal disposition, from their will, those we see acting freely for or against us, inspire us with like feelings to those they exhibit towards us. Something does us good, we seek after it; but we love the person who does us good; something harms us and we shrink from it, but we hate the person who tries to hurt us.
The child’s first sentiment is self-love, his second, which is derived from it, is love of those about him; for in his present state of weakness he is only aware of people through the help and attention received from them. At first his affection for his nurse and his governess is mere habit. He seeks them because he needs them and because he is happy when they are there; it is rather perception than kindly feeling. It takes a long time to discover not merely that they are useful to him, but that they desire to be useful to him, and then it is that he begins to love them.
So a child is naturally disposed to kindly feeling because he sees that every one about him is inclined to help him, and from this experience he gets the habit of a kindly feeling towards his species; but with the expansion of his relations, his needs, his dependence, active or passive, the consciousness of his relations to others is awakened, and leads to the sense of duties and preferences. Then the child becomes masterful, jealous, deceitful, and vindictive. If he is not compelled to obedience, when he does not see the usefulness of what he is told to do, he attributes it to caprice, to an intention of tormenting him, and he rebels. If people give in to him, as soon as anything opposes him he regards it as rebellion, as a determination to resist him; he beats the chair or table for disobeying him. Self-love, which concerns itself only with ourselves, is content to satisfy our own needs; but selfishness, which is always comparing self with others, is never satisfied and never can be; for this feeling, which prefers ourselves to others, requires that they should prefer us to themselves, which is impossible. Thus the tender and gentle passions spring from self-love, while the hateful and angry passions spring from selfishness. So it is the fewness of his needs, the narrow limits within which he can compare himself with others, that makes a man really good; what makes him really bad is a multiplicity of needs and dependence on the opinions of others. It is easy to see how we can apply this principle and guide every passion of children and men towards good or evil. True, man cannot always live alone, and it will be hard therefore to remain good; and this difficulty will increase of necessity as his relations with others are extended. For this reason, above all, the dangers of social life demand that the necessary skill and care shall be devoted to guarding the human heart against the depravity which springs from fresh needs.
Man’s proper study is that of his relation to his environment. So long as he only knows that environment through his physical nature, he should study himself in relation to things; this is the business of his childhood; when he begins to be aware of his moral nature, he should study himself in relation to his fellow-men; this is the business of his whole life, and we have now reached the time when that study should be begun.","宇宙的诞生始于混沌状态，阴阳二气在其中不断运动，互相作用，生成了万物。这是一种古老的自然哲学观念，其深邃的思想在千百年来影响着人类对于天地自然和自身存在的理解。阴阳作为宇宙的基本力量，既对立又统一，正是这种相辅相成的关系促成了世界的多样性和生命的无限可能性。

人，作为天地自然的产物，与宇宙息息相关。天赐予人类精神之源，地赐予形骸之质。精神和形体看似分离，实则相互依存，深刻体现了天地与人之间的密切联系。这种联系不是简单的物质关系，而是贯通于整个自然体系中的一种和谐与统一。

然而，现代社会中的人们往往追求身外之物，忽视了自身精神的内在价值。这种过度的物质追求，会使内心的精神受到损害，造成心志的混乱和五脏的不安宁。精神的内守，是人类自我修养的重要途径。只有保持内心的清明，才能避免外界的干扰和灾祸的侵扰。

保持精神和气血的内守与恬静，对于健康有着极其重要的影响。人们常在过度的嗜欲和情感中迷失，这不仅使精神耗散，还会对身体健康造成破坏。恬淡虚静，方能使精气充盈，使心志明晰，这是古老的智慧，也是现代人的修身之道。

面对纷扰的世界，我们更应追寻那份内在的宁静与平衡。精神的内守，不仅是对自我的一种保护，更是与天地自然和谐共生的根本。只有从自身开始，找到内心的平衡，才能真正体会到生命的意义和宇宙的本质。精神与形体的和谐，正如天地阴阳的互相作用，构成了人类存在的基础，也揭示了宇宙的奥秘。

在日常的生活中，我们可以通过自我的修养来实践这些哲学理念。保持内心的恬静，不为外物所动，关注自身的精神状态和气血调和。这样，我们不仅能在纷繁复杂的现实中找到属于自己的平静，还能在与天地自然的共鸣中获得深层次的满足。

总之，宇宙从混沌中诞生，阴阳二气生成万物，这不仅是一种自然哲学的深刻见解，也是对人与天地自然关系的深思。人的精神源自上天，形骸源自大地，精神与形体的内在联系，揭示了我们自身与宇宙整体的密切关联。而追求身外之物，损害内心精神，会使心志混乱，五脏不宁，最终成为健康的隐患。保持精神和气血的内守与恬静，避免过度的嗜欲和情感，是保持健康的关键。让我们在追求宁静与平衡的过程中，与天地自然和谐共生，深入理解精神与形体的内在联系，体会生命的真谛。",易,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage discusses the transformative period of adolescence marked by emotional and physical changes, indicating a transition from childhood to adulthood.

His eyes, those organs of the soul which till now were dumb, find speech and meaning; a kindling fire illumines them, there is still a sacred innocence in their ever brightening glance, but they have lost their first meaningless expression; he is already aware that they can say too much; he is beginning to learn to lower his eyes and blush, he is becoming sensitive, though he does not know what it is that he feels; he is uneasy without knowing why. All this may happen gradually and give you time enough; but if his keenness becomes impatience, his eagerness madness, if he is angry and sorry all in a moment, if he weeps without cause, if in the presence of objects which are beginning to be a source of danger his pulse quickens and his eyes sparkle, if he trembles when a woman’s hand touches his, if he is troubled or timid in her presence, O Ulysses, wise Ulysses! have a care! The passages you closed with so much pains are open; the winds are unloosed; keep your hand upon the helm or all is lost.
This is the second birth I spoke of; then it is that man really enters upon life; henceforth no human passion is a stranger to him. Our efforts so far have been child’s play, now they are of the greatest importance. This period when education is usually finished is just the time to begin; but to explain this new plan properly, let us take up our story where we left it.
Our passions are the chief means of self-preservation; to try to destroy them is therefore as absurd as it is useless; this would be to overcome nature, to reshape God’s handiwork. If God bade man annihilate the passions he has given him, God would bid him be and not be; He would contradict himself. He has never given such a foolish commandment, there is nothing like it written on the heart of man, and what God will have a man do, He does not leave to the words of another man. He speaks Himself; His words are written in the secret heart.
Now I consider those who would prevent the birth of the passions almost as foolish as those who would destroy them, and those who think this has been my object hitherto are greatly mistaken.
But should we reason rightly, if from the fact that passions are natural to man, we inferred that all the passions we feel in ourselves and behold in others are natural? Their source, indeed, is natural; but they have been swollen by a thousand other streams; they are a great river which is constantly growing, one in which we can scarcely find a single drop of the original stream. Our natural passions are few in number; they are the means to freedom, they tend to self-preservation. All those which enslave and destroy us have another source; nature does not bestow them on us; we seize on them in her despite.
The origin of our passions, the root and spring of all the rest, the only one which is born with man, which never leaves him as long as he lives, is self-love; this passion is primitive, instinctive, it precedes all the rest, which are in a sense only modifications of it. In this sense, if you like, they are all natural. But most of these modifications are the result of external influences, without which they would never occur, and such modifications, far from being advantageous to us, are harmful. They change the original purpose and work against its end; then it is that man finds himself outside nature and at strife with himself.
Self-love is always good, always in accordance with the order of nature. The preservation of our own life is specially entrusted to each one of us, and our first care is, and must be, to watch over our own life; and how can we continually watch over it, if we do not take the greatest interest in it?
Self-preservation requires, therefore, that we shall love ourselves; we must love ourselves above everything, and it follows directly from this that we love what contributes to our preservation. Every child becomes fond of its nurse; Romulus must have loved the she-wolf who suckled him. At first this attachment is quite unconscious; the individual is attracted to that which contributes to his welfare and repelled by that which is harmful; this is merely blind instinct. What transforms this instinct into feeling, the liking into love, the aversion into hatred, is the evident intention of helping or hurting us. We do not become passionately attached to objects without feeling, which only follow the direction given them; but those from which we expect benefit or injury from their internal disposition, from their will, those we see acting freely for or against us, inspire us with like feelings to those they exhibit towards us. Something does us good, we seek after it; but we love the person who does us good; something harms us and we shrink from it, but we hate the person who tries to hurt us.
The child’s first sentiment is self-love, his second, which is derived from it, is love of those about him; for in his present state of weakness he is only aware of people through the help and attention received from them. At first his affection for his nurse and his governess is mere habit. He seeks them because he needs them and because he is happy when they are there; it is rather perception than kindly feeling. It takes a long time to discover not merely that they are useful to him, but that they desire to be useful to him, and then it is that he begins to love them.
So a child is naturally disposed to kindly feeling because he sees that every one about him is inclined to help him, and from this experience he gets the habit of a kindly feeling towards his species; but with the expansion of his relations, his needs, his dependence, active or passive, the consciousness of his relations to others is awakened, and leads to the sense of duties and preferences. Then the child becomes masterful, jealous, deceitful, and vindictive. If he is not compelled to obedience, when he does not see the usefulness of what he is told to do, he attributes it to caprice, to an intention of tormenting him, and he rebels. If people give in to him, as soon as anything opposes him he regards it as rebellion, as a determination to resist him; he beats the chair or table for disobeying him. Self-love, which concerns itself only with ourselves, is content to satisfy our own needs; but selfishness, which is always comparing self with others, is never satisfied and never can be; for this feeling, which prefers ourselves to others, requires that they should prefer us to themselves, which is impossible. Thus the tender and gentle passions spring from self-love, while the hateful and angry passions spring from selfishness. So it is the fewness of his needs, the narrow limits within which he can compare himself with others, that makes a man really good; what makes him really bad is a multiplicity of needs and dependence on the opinions of others. It is easy to see how we can apply this principle and guide every passion of children and men towards good or evil. True, man cannot always live alone, and it will be hard therefore to remain good; and this difficulty will increase of necessity as his relations with others are extended. For this reason, above all, the dangers of social life demand that the necessary skill and care shall be devoted to guarding the human heart against the depravity which springs from fresh needs.
Man’s proper study is that of his relation to his environment. So long as he only knows that environment through his physical nature, he should study himself in relation to things; this is the business of his childhood; when he begins to be aware of his moral nature, he should study himself in relation to his fellow-men; this is the business of his whole life, and we have now reached the time when that study should be begun.",,,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage discusses the transformative period of adolescence marked by emotional and physical changes, indicating a transition from childhood to adulthood.

"As the roaring of the waves precedes the tempest, so the murmur of rising passions announces this tumultuous change; a suppressed excitement warns us of the approaching danger. A change of temper, frequent outbreaks of anger, a perpetual stirring of the mind, make the child almost ungovernable. He becomes deaf to the voice he used to obey; he is a lion in a fever; he distrusts his keeper and refuses to be controlled.
With the moral symptoms of a changing temper there are perceptible changes in appearance. His countenance develops and takes the stamp of his character; the soft and sparse down upon his cheeks becomes darker and stiffer. His voice grows hoarse or rather he loses it altogether. He is neither a child nor a man and cannot speak like either of them.

"The objective Mind is the absolute Idea, but only existing in posse: and as it is thus on the territory of finitude, its actual rationality retains the aspect of external apparency. The free will finds itself immediately confronted by differences which arise from the circumstance that freedom is its inward function and aim, and is in relation to an external and already subsisting objectivity, which splits up into different heads: viz. anthropological data (i.e. private and personal needs), external things of nature which exist for consciousness, and the ties of relation between individual wills which are conscious of their own diversity and particularity. These aspects constitute the external material for the embodiment of the will.
§ 484. But the purposive action of this will is to realise its concept, Liberty, in these externally-objective aspects, making the latter a world moulded by the former, which in it is thus at home with itself, locked together with it: the concept accordingly perfected to the Idea. Liberty, shaped into the actuality of a world, receives the form of Necessity the deeper substantial nexus of which is the system or organisation of the principles of liberty, whilst its phenomenal nexus is power or authority, [pg 104]and the sentiment of obedience awakened in consciousness.
§ 485. This unity of the rational will with the single will (this being the peculiar and immediate medium in which the former is actualised) constitutes the simple actuality of liberty. As it (and its content) belongs to thought, and is the virtual universal, the content has its right and true character only in the form of universality. When invested with this character for the intelligent consciousness, or instituted as an authoritative power, it is a Law150. When, on the other hand, the content is freed from the mixedness and fortuitousness, attaching to it in the practical feeling and in impulse, and is set and grafted in the individual will, not in the form of impulse, but in its universality, so as to become its habit, temper and character, it exists as manner and custom, or Usage151.
§ 486. This “reality,” in general, where free will has existence, is the Law (Right),—the term being taken in a comprehensive sense not merely as the limited juristic law, but as the actual body of all the conditions of freedom. These conditions, in relation to the subjective will, where they, being universal, ought to have and can only have their existence, are its Duties; whereas as its temper and habit they are Manners. What is a right is also a duty, and what is a duty, is also a right. For a mode of existence is a right, only as a consequence of the free substantial will: and the same content of fact, when referred to the will distinguished as subjective and individual, is a duty. It is the same content which the subjective consciousness recognises as a duty, and brings into existence in these several wills. The finitude of the objective will thus creates the semblance of a distinction between rights and duties.

In the phenomenal range right and duty are correlata, at least in the sense that to a right on my part corresponds a duty in some one else. But, in the light of the concept, my right to a thing is not merely possession, but as possession by a person it is property, or legal possession, and it is a duty to possess things as property, i.e. to be as a person. Translated into the phenomenal relationship, viz. relation to another person—this grows into the duty of some one else to respect my right. In the morality of the conscience, duty in general is in me—a free subject—at the same time a right of my subjective will or disposition. But in this individualist moral sphere, there arises the division between what is only inward purpose (disposition or intention), which only has its being in me and is merely subjective duty, and the actualisation of that purpose: and with this division a contingency and imperfection which makes the inadequacy of mere individualistic morality. In social ethics these two parts have reached their truth, their absolute unity; although even right and duty return to one another and combine by means of certain adjustments and under the guise of necessity.

All the aims of society and the State are the private aim of the individuals.

"In an earlier review of Kant's work (Werke, i. 83) on Glauben und Wissen (an article in Sendling and Hegel's Journal) Hegel attaches more weight to a factor in the critical theory of knowledge, here neglected. Kant, he says, has—[Pg 399]within the limits allowed by his psychological terms of thought—'put (in an excellent way) the à priori of sensibility into the original identity and multiplicity, and that as transcendental imagination in the ""higher power"" of an immersion of unity in multiplicity: whilst Understanding (Verstand) he makes to consist in the elevation to universality of this à priori synthetic unity of sensibility,—whereby this identity is invested with a comparative antithesis to the sensibility: and Reason (Vernunft) is presented as a still higher power over the preceding comparative antithesis, without however this universality and infinity being allowed to go beyond the stereotyped formal pure infinity. This genuinely rational construction by which, though the bad name ""faculties"" is left, there is in truth presented a single identity of them all, is transformed by Jacobi into a series of faculties, resting one upon another.'

That means: it contains the same view of facts, but in its method is quite independent of the Kantian exposition.' 'Kant, up to now, is a closed book.'—i. 442. There are two ways of critical idealism. 'Either' (as Fichte) 'it actually deduces from the fundamental laws of intelligence, that system of necessary modes of action, and with it, at the same time, the objective conceptions thus arising, and thus lets the whole compass of our conceptions gradually arise under the eyes of the reader or hearer; or' (like Kant and his unprogressive disciples) 'it gets hold of these laws from anywhere and anyhow, as they are immediately applied to objects, therefore on their lowest grade (—on this grade they are called categories), and then asseverates that it is by these that objects are determined and arranged.' And i. 478: 'I know that the categories which Kant laid down are in no way proved by him to be conditions of self-consciousness, but only said to be so: I know that space and time and what in the original consciousness is inseparable from them and fills them both, are still less deduced as such conditions, for of them it is not even said expressly—as of the categories—that they are so, but only inferentially. But I believe quite as surely that I know that Kant had the thought of such a system: that everything he actually propounds are fragments and results of this system; and that his statements have meaning and coherence only on this presupposition.'

P. 89, § 42. Transcendental unity of self-consciousness. Kant's Kritik der reinen Vernunft, § 16: 'The I think must be able to accompany all my ideas.... This idea is an act of spontaneity. ... I name it pure apperception ... or original apperception ... because it is that self-consciousness which can be accompanied by none further. The unity of it I also call the transcendental unity of self-consciousness, in order to denote the possibility of cognition à priori from it.'
P. 92, § 44. Caput mortuum: a term of the Alchemists to denote the non-volatile precipitate left in the retort after the spirit had been extracted: the fixed or dead remains, 'quando spiritus animam sursum vexit.'
P. 92, § 45. Reason and Understanding. In the Wolfian School (e.g. in Baumgarten's Metaphysik, § 468) the term intellect (Verstand) is used of the general faculty of higher cognition, while ratio (Vernunft) specially denotes the power of seeing distinctly the connexions of things. So Wolff (Vernünftige Gedanken von Gott, &c. § 277) defines Verstand as 'the faculty of distinctly representing the possible,' and Vernunft (§ 368) as 'the faculty of seeing into the connexion of truths.' It is on this use of Reason as the faculty of inference that Kant's use of the term is founded: though it soon widely departs from its origin. For upon the 'formal' use of reason as the faculty of syllogising, Kant superinduces a transcendental use as a 'faculty of principles,' while the understanding is only 'a faculty of rules.' 'Reason,' in other words, 'itself begets conceptions,' and 'maxims, which it borrows neither from the senses nor from the understanding.' (Kritik d. r. Vern., Dialektik, Einleit. ii. A.) And the essential aim of Reason is to give unity to the various cognitions of understanding. While the unity given by understanding is 'unity of a possible experience,' that sought by reason is the discovery of an unconditioned which will complete the unity of the former (Dial. Einleit. iv), or of 'the totality of the conditions to a given conditioned.' (Dial, vii.)
It is this distinction of the terms which is dominant in Fichte and Hegel, where Verstand is the more practical intellect which seeks definite and restricted results and knowledges, while Vernunft is a deeper and higher power which aims at completeness. In Goethe's more reflective prose we see illustrations of this usage: e.g. Wilh. Meister's Wanderjahre, i. it is said to be the object of the 'reasonable' man 'das entgegengesetzte zu überschauen[Pg 401] und in Uebereinstimmung zu bringen': or Bk. ii. Reasonable men when they have devised something verständig to get this or that difficulty out of the way, &c. Goethe, in his Sprüche in Prosa (896), Werke, iii. 281, says 'Reason has for its province the thing in process (das Werdende), understanding the thing completed (das Gewordene): the former does not trouble itself about the purpose, the latter asks not whence. Reason takes delight in developing; understanding wishes to keep everything as it is, so as to use it.' (Similarly in Eckermann's Convers. Feb. 13, 1829.) Cf. Oken, Naturphilosophie, § 2914. Verstand ist Microcosmus, Vernunft Macrocosmus.
Kant's use of the term Reason, coupled with his special view of Practical Reason and his use of the term Faith (Glaube), leads on to the terminology of Jacobi. In earlier writings Jacobi had insisted on the contrast between the superior authority of feeling and faith (which are in touch with truth) and the mechanical method of intelligence and reasoning (Verstand and Vernunft). At a later period however he changed and fixed the nomenclature of his distinction. What he had first called Glaube he latterly called Vernunft,—which is in brief a 'sense for the supersensible'—an intuition giving higher and complete or total knowledge—an immediate apprehension of the real and the true. As contrasted with this reasonable faith or feeling, he regards Verstand as a mere faculty of inference or derivative knowledge, referring one thing to another by the rule of identity.
This distinction which is substantially reproduced by Coleridge (though with certain clauses that show traces of Schellingian influence) has connexions—like so much else in Jacobi—with the usage of Schopenhauer, 'Nobody,' says Jacobi, 'has ever spoken of an animal Vernunft: a mere animal Verstand however we all know and speak of.' (Jacobi's Werke, iii. 8.) Schopenhauer repeats and enforces the remark. All animals possess, says Schopenhauer, the power of apprehending causality, of cognising objects: a power of immediate and intuitive knowledge of real things: this is Verstand. But Vernunft, which is peculiar to man, is the cognition of truth (not of reality): it is an abstract judgment with a sufficient reason (Welt als W. i. § 6).","宇宙的诞生可追溯至混沌——一种无形无象、未有区分的状态。在此状态下，天地未分，人物未现。然而，正是在这种混沌中，阴阳二气逐渐显现，阴阳的互相作用成为了宇宙演化的关键。阴阳之气的交织和运行，似乎是一种不息的舞蹈，伴随它们的轮转，一切万物开始诞生、生长与发展。这便是宇宙万物的根源所在，也是宇宙秩序的根本所在。在这个大架构中，人与天地自然并非隔绝，而是相互依存、息息相关的存在。

人的内在精神，也即“心神”，源自上天，天赋之灵性使得精神具有某种无限性与高贵性。而人的形体，源自于大地，是无数物质组成的载体。精神与形体这两者之间有着深刻的内在联系，它们共同构成人的存在基础。精神是形体的统御者，而形体则为精神提供活动的场所。这种联系并非只是表面的，而是深入到每一个层面。保持内心精神的清明，就是保养形体健康的一个关键途径。

在当今社会，物质的聚集和外在成就常常被视作人生的终极目标。然而，过度追求外在之物，往往会损害内心之精神。精神一旦被物欲蒙蔽，心志自然变得混乱不清，五脏六腑也会因此受到负面影响，经脉的运行不畅，气血便会失调，各种疾病随之而来。因此，保持精神内守至关重要。精神内守，即是少受外物干扰，回归本心，使心志如清泉一般清澈明净，这样才能使五脏六腑安宁，从而避免一切外界灾祸的侵扰。

在保持精神和气血内守的过程中，恬静是一个重要的状态。恬静不仅是表象上的平静，更是一种心境的安宁和轻松，这种安宁和轻松有助于维持精神的稳定与气血的平和。恬静之中，心志不会因为外界的纷扰而动摇，气血在安然流动中滋养体内的每一个细胞和组织。通过恬静，精神能够内守，五脏六腑得以安宁，人与自然的关系也因此更加和谐。

然而，现代社会中为追求功名利禄和感官享受，许多人嗜欲过度，情感泛滥。从哲学角度来看，嗜欲与情感一旦超过节制，便会导致人的精气耗散。精气是身体的根本，也是生命活动的基础，一旦精气耗散过度，形体便面临亏损，健康状态也会下滑。嗜欲与情感过度不仅扰乱精神，还会导致内里气血失衡，与天地自然的和谐关系被破坏，最终引起疾病和衰老。

综上所述，宇宙之根源在于阴阳二气的交织，人与天地自然是一体不可分割的整体。精神源自上天，形体源自大地，二者在人体中相辅相成。保持精神清明、气血内守、心志恬静，是确保健康长寿的重要法则。追求外在之物往往会伤及内心精神，导致气血失调，最终损害健康。因此，告诫世人，应以保养精神为重，内守恬静，避免嗜欲与情感的过度。唯有如此，才能实现身心的和谐统一，与天地自然共生共荣。",易,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage explores various philosophical interpretations and distinctions related to Kant's theories, primarily focusing on the concepts of Reason (Vernunft) and Understanding (Verstand).

"(a) Time is not something which subsists of itself, or which inheres in things as an objective determination, and therefore remains, when abstraction is made of the subjective conditions of the intuition of things. For in the former case, it would be something real, yet without presenting to any power of perception any real object. In the latter case, as an order or determination inherent in things themselves, it could not be antecedent to things, as their condition, nor discerned or intuited by means of synthetical propositions à priori. But all this is quite possible when we regard time as merely the subjective condition under which all our intuitions take place. For in that case, this form of the inward intuition can be represented prior to the objects, and consequently à priori.
(b) Time is nothing else than the form of the internal sense, that is, of the intuitions of self and of our internal state. For time cannot be any determination of outward phenomena. It has to do neither with shape nor position; on the contrary, it determines the relation of representations in our internal state. And precisely because this internal intuition presents to us no shape or form, we endeavour to supply this want by analogies, and represent the course of time by a line progressing to infinity, the content of which constitutes a series which is only of one dimension; and we conclude from the properties of this line as to all the properties of time, with this single exception, that the parts of the line are coexistent, whilst those of time are successive. From this it is clear also that the representation of time is itself an intuition, because all its relations can be expressed in an external intuition.
(c) Time is the formal condition à priori of all phenomena whatsoever. Space, as the pure form of external intuition, is limited as a condition à priori to external phenomena alone. On the other hand, because all representations, whether they have or have not external things for their objects, still in themselves, as determinations of the mind, belong to our internal state; and because this internal state is subject to the formal condition of the internal intuition, that is, to time—time is a condition à priori of all phenomena whatsoever—the immediate condition of all internal, and thereby the mediate condition of all external phenomena. If I can say à priori, “All outward phenomena are in space, and determined à priori according to the relations of space,” I can also, from the principle of the internal sense, affirm universally, “All phenomena in general, that is, all objects of the senses, are in time and stand necessarily in relations of time.”
If we abstract our internal intuition of ourselves and all external intuitions, possible only by virtue of this internal intuition and presented to us by our faculty of representation, and consequently take objects as they are in themselves, then time is nothing. It is only of objective validity in regard to phenomena, because these are things which we regard as objects of our senses. It no longer objective we, make abstraction of the sensuousness of our intuition, in other words, of that mode of representation which is peculiar to us, and speak of things in general. Time is therefore merely a subjective condition of our (human) intuition (which is always sensuous, that is, so far as we are affected by objects), and in itself, independently of the mind or subject, is nothing. Nevertheless, in respect of all phenomena, consequently of all things which come within the sphere of our experience, it is necessarily objective. We cannot say, “All things are in time,” because in this conception of things in general, we abstract and make no mention of any sort of intuition of things. But this is the proper condition under which time belongs to our representation of objects. If we add the condition to the conception, and say, “All things, as phenomena, that is, objects of sensuous intuition, are in time,” then the proposition has its sound objective validity and universality à priori.
What we have now set forth teaches, therefore, the empirical reality of time; that is, its objective validity in reference to all objects which can ever be presented to our senses. And as our intuition is always sensuous, no object ever can be presented to us in experience, which does not come under the conditions of time. On the other hand, we deny to time all claim to absolute reality; that is, we deny that it, without having regard to the form of our sensuous intuition, absolutely inheres in things as a condition or property. Such properties as belong to objects as things in themselves never can be presented to us through the medium of the senses. Herein consists, therefore, the transcendental ideality of time, according to which, if we abstract the subjective conditions of sensuous intuition, it is nothing, and cannot be reckoned as subsisting or inhering in objects as things in themselves, independently of its relation to our intuition. This ideality, like that of space, is not to be proved or illustrated by fallacious analogies with sensations, for this reason—that in such arguments or illustrations, we make the presupposition that the phenomenon, in which such and such predicates inhere, has objective reality, while in this case we can only find such an objective reality as is itself empirical, that is, regards the object as a mere phenomenon. In reference to this subject, see the remark in Section I (§ 4)
",在时间的长河中，宇宙从不可思议的混沌状态中诞生，经历了千百劫的演化，最终形成了我们所知的世界。在这个绚丽多彩的宇宙中，阴阳二气互为作用，彼此交融，形成了万事万物。天地之间，万物生灭不息，正是在这种阴阳循环中，宇宙展现了它无尽的多样与和谐。正是这种阴阳二气的互动，使得宇宙呈现出多样性与统一性，从最深奥的法则到最具体的现象，无一不体现这一原理的神奇与玄妙。通过这一过程，我们不仅得以窥见宇宙的奥秘，更得以理解自然的规律和生命的本质。阴与阳并不是孤立存在的，而是互为条件、相互转化的。这种消长变化和生生不息的过程，构建了宇宙万物存在的基础，也塑造了人类的命运与生活环境。因此，我们必须尊重自然的这种神秘法则，在与天地的相互作用中，从微观到宏观寻求人与自然的和谐之道。这种和谐不仅是物理意义上的，更是精神层次上的，它要求我们从心灵深处理解和感受宇宙的脉搏，与万物一起跳动，与天地一起呼吸。所谓‘天人合一’的哲学理念，正是在这种宏大眼光下诞生的。它不只是一个思想概念，更是一个生活指导方针，提醒着人类在追求物质繁荣的同时，不要忽视内心的修养和精神的提升。 人作为天地自然的一部分，精神与形骸分别源自上天和大地。人的精神源自上天，意味着我们的灵性、智慧和意识是天赋的，是超越物质界的存在。而形骸源自大地，则代表我们身体、肉体的部分是地球孕育的，是具体物质的体现。精神与形态的内在联系，正是天地之间阴阳二气在个体中的具体显现。这不仅揭示了人的生命本质，也指引了我们如何在实际生活中平衡身心。精神虽然是无形的存在，但却对我们的形体有深远影响。反之，形体的健康状态也直接反映和影响我们的精神状态。力量强盛的精神能够提升形体的健康，而形体的病痛也会极大程度地压抑我们的精神。因此，关注精神的修养与形体的健康即是关注天地赋予我们的本质，是返回和遵循自然法则的智慧之举。 在这一过程中，我们要警惕一种误区，即追求身外之物会损害内心精神。物质的富裕和外在的成就并不是我们真正所需的目标。外在世界的各种诱惑和吸引力往往会使我们迷失本心，忽略了内心的宁静与满足。相反，保持精神内守，能够使我们的心志清明，五脏安宁，避免外界的不良干扰。内心的安宁不只是一种精神状态，更是一种健康的标志。五脏六腑在平和安宁中运转，精气神得以充盈，这样的人生才是真正的健全与幸福。 保持精神和气血的内守与恬静，正是维持健康的关键所在。在现代社会中，人们往往被各种物质和生活压力所围困，导致精神紧张，气血紊乱。我们需要不断提醒自己，内守是对自身最深层的关怀，它不仅是对精神的保护，更是对身体的养护。嗜欲和情感的过度会导致精气耗散，进而损害健康。每个人的精气神都是有限的资源，如若不加节制地挥霍，终将导致身体和精神的双重损害。嗜欲过度的人仿佛是在燃烧自己的生命，虽然一时绚丽，但结果必然是精气的迅速消耗和健康的彻底瓦解。情感的波动也是如此，看似我们在情感中得到了满足，但过度的情感消耗会使我们的内心变得疲惫和空虚。 由此可见，哲学不仅仅是对宇宙和人生的探讨，更是对生活实践的指导。我们要从哲学的角度，在日常生活中寻找到精神与物质、内心与外在的平衡。理解和尊重宇宙的阴阳法则，关注自身的精神与形态，内守精神和气血，才能走向真正的健康与幸福道路。只有这样，我们才能在物质和精神、个人与自然之间找到真正的和谐，走向生命的智慧与圆满。,易,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage discusses the concept of time from a philosophical perspective. It argues that time is not an independent entity or an inherent property of objects, but rather a subjective condition of the internal sense through which humans perceive their own mental states and internal experiences. It contrasts this view with the idea of space, which is considered the form of external intuition and pertains to external phenomena. Time, as an internal intuition, determines the relations of internal representations and is necessary for all phenomena as experienced by humans. While time is empirically real in the context of human experience, it lacks absolute reality and does not inhere in objects independently of human perception. The passage emphasizes the transcendental ideality of time, meaning that its existence is contingent on the way humans intuitively perceive and represent objects.",927
"(a) Time is not something which subsists of itself, or which inheres in things as an objective determination, and therefore remains, when abstraction is made of the subjective conditions of the intuition of things. For in the former case, it would be something real, yet without presenting to any power of perception any real object. In the latter case, as an order or determination inherent in things themselves, it could not be antecedent to things, as their condition, nor discerned or intuited by means of synthetical propositions à priori. But all this is quite possible when we regard time as merely the subjective condition under which all our intuitions take place. For in that case, this form of the inward intuition can be represented prior to the objects, and consequently à priori.
(b) Time is nothing else than the form of the internal sense, that is, of the intuitions of self and of our internal state. For time cannot be any determination of outward phenomena. It has to do neither with shape nor position; on the contrary, it determines the relation of representations in our internal state. And precisely because this internal intuition presents to us no shape or form, we endeavour to supply this want by analogies, and represent the course of time by a line progressing to infinity, the content of which constitutes a series which is only of one dimension; and we conclude from the properties of this line as to all the properties of time, with this single exception, that the parts of the line are coexistent, whilst those of time are successive. From this it is clear also that the representation of time is itself an intuition, because all its relations can be expressed in an external intuition.
(c) Time is the formal condition à priori of all phenomena whatsoever. Space, as the pure form of external intuition, is limited as a condition à priori to external phenomena alone. On the other hand, because all representations, whether they have or have not external things for their objects, still in themselves, as determinations of the mind, belong to our internal state; and because this internal state is subject to the formal condition of the internal intuition, that is, to time—time is a condition à priori of all phenomena whatsoever—the immediate condition of all internal, and thereby the mediate condition of all external phenomena. If I can say à priori, “All outward phenomena are in space, and determined à priori according to the relations of space,” I can also, from the principle of the internal sense, affirm universally, “All phenomena in general, that is, all objects of the senses, are in time and stand necessarily in relations of time.”
If we abstract our internal intuition of ourselves and all external intuitions, possible only by virtue of this internal intuition and presented to us by our faculty of representation, and consequently take objects as they are in themselves, then time is nothing. It is only of objective validity in regard to phenomena, because these are things which we regard as objects of our senses. It no longer objective we, make abstraction of the sensuousness of our intuition, in other words, of that mode of representation which is peculiar to us, and speak of things in general. Time is therefore merely a subjective condition of our (human) intuition (which is always sensuous, that is, so far as we are affected by objects), and in itself, independently of the mind or subject, is nothing. Nevertheless, in respect of all phenomena, consequently of all things which come within the sphere of our experience, it is necessarily objective. We cannot say, “All things are in time,” because in this conception of things in general, we abstract and make no mention of any sort of intuition of things. But this is the proper condition under which time belongs to our representation of objects. If we add the condition to the conception, and say, “All things, as phenomena, that is, objects of sensuous intuition, are in time,” then the proposition has its sound objective validity and universality à priori.
What we have now set forth teaches, therefore, the empirical reality of time; that is, its objective validity in reference to all objects which can ever be presented to our senses. And as our intuition is always sensuous, no object ever can be presented to us in experience, which does not come under the conditions of time. On the other hand, we deny to time all claim to absolute reality; that is, we deny that it, without having regard to the form of our sensuous intuition, absolutely inheres in things as a condition or property. Such properties as belong to objects as things in themselves never can be presented to us through the medium of the senses. Herein consists, therefore, the transcendental ideality of time, according to which, if we abstract the subjective conditions of sensuous intuition, it is nothing, and cannot be reckoned as subsisting or inhering in objects as things in themselves, independently of its relation to our intuition. This ideality, like that of space, is not to be proved or illustrated by fallacious analogies with sensations, for this reason—that in such arguments or illustrations, we make the presupposition that the phenomenon, in which such and such predicates inhere, has objective reality, while in this case we can only find such an objective reality as is itself empirical, that is, regards the object as a mere phenomenon.

"(a) Physical perfection; that is, cultivation of all our faculties generally for the promotion of the ends set before us by reason. That this is a duty, and therefore an end in itself, and that the effort to effect this even without regard to the advantage that it secures us, is based, not on a conditional (pragmatic), but an unconditional (moral) imperative, may be seen from the following consideration. The power of proposing to ourselves an end is the characteristic of humanity (as distinguished from the brutes). With the end of humanity in our own person is therefore combined the rational will, and consequently the duty of deserving well of humanity by culture generally, by acquiring or advancing the power to carry out all sorts of possible ends, so far as this power is to be found in man; that is, it is a duty to cultivate the crude capacities of our nature, since it is by that cultivation that the animal is raised to man, therefore it is a duty in itself.
This duty, however, is merely ethical, that is, of indeterminate obligation. No principle of reason prescribes how far one must go in this effort (in enlarging or correcting his faculty of understanding, that is, in acquisition of knowledge or technical capacity); and besides the difference in the circumstances into which men may come makes the choice of the kind of employment for which he should cultivate his talent very arbitrary. Here, therefore, there is no law of reason for actions, but only for the maxim of actions, viz.: ""Cultivate thy faculties of mind and body so as to be effective for all ends that may come in thy way, uncertain which of them may become thy own.""
(b) Cultivation of Morality in ourselves. The greatest moral perfection of man is to do his duty, and that from duty (that the law be not only the rule but also the spring of his actions). Now at first sight this seems to be a strict obligation, and as if the principle of duty commanded not merely the legality of every action, but also the morality, i.e., the mental disposition, with the exactness and strictness of a law; but in fact the law commands even here only the maxim of the action, namely, that we should seek the ground of obligation, not in the sensible impulses (advantage or disadvantage), but wholly in the law; so that the action itself is not commanded. For it is not possible to man to see so far into the depth of his own heart that he could ever be thoroughly certain of the purity of his moral purpose and the sincerity of his mind even in one single action, although he has no doubt about the legality of it. Nay, often the weakness which deters a man from the risk of a crime is regarded by him as virtue (which gives the notion of strength). And how many there are who may have led a long blameless life, who are only fortunate in having escaped so many temptations. How much of the element of pure morality in their mental disposition may have belonged to each deed remains hidden even from themselves.
Accordingly, this duty to estimate the worth of one's actions not merely by their legality, but also by their morality (mental disposition), is only of indeterminate obligation; the law does not command this internal action in the human mind itself, but only the maxim of the action, namely, that we should strive with all our power that for all dutiful actions the thought of duty should be of itself an adequate spring.
","在宇宙万象初开之际，混沌之中孕育了阴阳二气。这两种看似对立却又互相交融的力量，推动了万物的生成与演化。阴阳二气，如同宇宙的呼吸，交替往复，形成了天、地与人之间的微妙联系。这种自然界的法则不仅仅是物质层面的运作，它亦揭示了人与天地、自然的深层关系，揭示了精神世界的奥秘和形体的来源与归宿。

人，作为万物之灵长，其精神之源来自于苍穹，形骸之躯则衍生于大地。这一内在联系，显示了人类不仅仅是肉体的存在，而是一个综合的生命体，融合了天的灵气与地的精华。精神与形体的双重属性，构建了人类的本质，使我们在追求物质满足的同时，不应忽视精神的修养与滋养。

然而，现实中，许多人被外界之物所吸引，追求名利、财富和地位，忘却了精神的内守与平静。这种外在的追逐虽能短暂地满足我们的欲望，但长久之下，却会侵蚀我们的内心。当精神被身外之物所牵制，内心的清明与平静便会被动摇，五脏六腑也会因之失调，容易引发各种疾病与灾祸。就如同一棵被过度攀附的树，其主干必然会因承受不了重量而崩塌。

内守精神，恬静平心，乃是修养之道。古圣先贤早已洞悉此理，强调在纷繁复杂的世务中保持内心的安宁。清心寡欲，才能让心志清明，五脏得以安宁。精神和气血的内守与平静，是保证身心健康的重要因素。它犹如一片宁静的湖水，不仅能自照万物，还能自持清澈不染。

嗜欲和情感过度，是精气耗散的主要原因。人若长久沉湎于物质欲望和情感的波动中，精神必然疲惫不堪，气血亦会因此而耗散。这种耗散不仅影响当下的健康，更会对未来产生深远的负面影响。正如张岱所言：“人之情欲，如江水，不时疏泄，必有溢堤之患。”现代生活中，各种欲望如洪水般涌来，人们若不加以节制，必会被其吞噬。

反之，若能做到精神内守，静心寡欲，便可使精气充沛，神清气爽。道德经有言：“致虚极，守静笃。”这是提醒我们，在追求外物的同时，更应关注内心的修养。内心的宁静与稳固，才是面对外界变化的根本立足之道。

在当今社会，信息爆炸，物质丰富，人们的欲望被不断地激发与放大。我们应汲取古人的智慧，平衡物质与精神的关系，避免过度追求外在而忽视内心的修炼。只有保持精神的内守与恬静，才能拥有真正的幸福与安宁。

总之，宇宙从混沌中产生阴阳二气，推动万物生成，形成了人与天地自然的关系。人的精神来自上天，形体源自大地，精神与形体密不可分。追求外物会损害内心精神，保持精神内守则能使人心志清明，五脏安宁，避免灾祸。保持精神和气血的内守与恬静非常重要，过度的欲望和情感会导致精气耗散，损害健康，内守精神，恬静平心，方能使身心健康，终得安宁。",易,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage discusses two types of perfection: physical and moral.

With the end of humanity in our own person is therefore combined the rational will, and consequently the duty of deserving well of humanity by culture generally, by acquiring or advancing the power to carry out all sorts of possible ends, so far as this power is to be found in man; that is, it is a duty to cultivate the crude capacities of our nature, since it is by that cultivation that the animal is raised to man, therefore it is a duty in itself.
This duty, however, is merely ethical, that is, of indeterminate obligation. No principle of reason prescribes how far one must go in this effort (in enlarging or correcting his faculty of understanding, that is, in acquisition of knowledge or technical capacity); and besides the difference in the circumstances into which men may come makes the choice of the kind of employment for which he should cultivate his talent very arbitrary. Here, therefore, there is no law of reason for actions, but only for the maxim of actions, viz.: ""Cultivate thy faculties of mind and body so as to be effective for all ends that may come in thy way, uncertain which of them may become thy own.""
(b) Cultivation of Morality in ourselves. The greatest moral perfection of man is to do his duty, and that from duty (that the law be not only the rule but also the spring of his actions). Now at first sight this seems to be a strict obligation, and as if the principle of duty commanded not merely the legality of every action, but also the morality, i.e., the mental disposition, with the exactness and strictness of a law; but in fact the law commands even here only the maxim of the action, namely, that we should seek the ground of obligation, not in the sensible impulses (advantage or disadvantage), but wholly in the law; so that the action itself is not commanded. For it is not possible to man to see so far into the depth of his own heart that he could ever be thoroughly certain of the purity of his moral purpose and the sincerity of his mind even in one single action, although he has no doubt about the legality of it. Nay, often the weakness which deters a man from the risk of a crime is regarded by him as virtue (which gives the notion of strength). And how many there are who may have led a long blameless life, who are only fortunate in having escaped so many temptations. How much of the element of pure morality in their mental disposition may have belonged to each deed remains hidden even from themselves.
Accordingly, this duty to estimate the worth of one's actions not merely by their legality, but also by their morality (mental disposition), is only of indeterminate obligation; the law does not command this internal action in the human mind itself, but only the maxim of the action, namely, that we should strive with all our power that for all dutiful actions the thought of duty should be of itself an adequate spring.

"And thus, Glaucon, after the argument has gone a weary way, the true and the false philosophers have at length appeared in view.

I do not think, he said, that the way could have been shortened.

I suppose not, I said; and yet I believe that we might have had a better view of both of them if the discussion could have been confined to this one subject and if there were not many other questions awaiting us, which he who desires to see in what respect the life of the just differs from that of the unjust must consider.

And what is the next question? he asked.

Surely, I said, the one which follows next in order. Inasmuch as philosophers only are able to grasp the eternal and unchangeable, and those who wander in the region of the many and variable are not philosophers, I must ask you which of the two classes should be the rulers of our State?

And how can we rightly answer that question?

Whichever of the two are best able to guard the laws and institutions of our State—let them be our guardians.

Very good.

Neither, I said, can there be any question that the guardian who is to keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes?

There can be no question of that.

And are not those who are verily and indeed wanting in the knowledge of the true being of each thing, and who have in their souls no clear pattern, and are unable as with a painter’s eye to look at the absolute truth and to that original to repair, and having perfect vision of the other world to order the laws about beauty, goodness, justice in this, if not already ordered, and to guard and preserve the order of them—are not such persons, I ask, simply blind?

Truly, he replied, they are much in that condition.

And shall they be our guardians when there are others who, besides being their equals in experience and falling short of them in no particular of virtue, also know the very truth of each thing?

There can be no reason, he said, for rejecting those who have this greatest of all great qualities; they must always have the first place unless they fail in some other respect.

Suppose then, I said, that we determine how far they can unite this and the other excellences.

By all means.

In the first place, as we began by observing, the nature of the philosopher has to be ascertained. We must come to an understanding about him, and, when we have done so, then, if I am not mistaken, we shall also acknowledge that such an union of qualities is possible, and that those in whom they are united, and those only, should be rulers in the State.

What do you mean?

Let us suppose that philosophical minds always love knowledge of a sort which shows them the eternal nature not varying from generation and corruption.

Agreed.

And further, I said, let us agree that they are lovers of all true being; there is no part whether greater or less, or more or less honourable, which they are willing to renounce; as we said before of the lover and the man of ambition.

True.

And if they are to be what we were describing, is there not another quality which they should also possess?

What quality?

Truthfulness: they will never intentionally receive into their mind falsehood, which is their detestation, and they will love the truth.

Yes, that may be safely affirmed of them.

‘May be,’ my friend, I replied, is not the word; say rather ‘must be affirmed:’ for he whose nature is amorous of anything cannot help loving all that belongs or is akin to the object of his affections.

Right, he said.

And is there anything more akin to wisdom than truth?

How can there be?

Can the same nature be a lover of wisdom and a lover of falsehood?

Never.

The true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth, as far as in him lies, desire all truth?

Assuredly.

But then again, as we know by experience, he whose desires are strong in one direction will have them weaker in others; they will be like a stream which has been drawn off into another channel.

True.

He whose desires are drawn towards knowledge in every form will be absorbed in the pleasures of the soul, and will hardly feel bodily pleasure—I mean, if he be a true philosopher and not a sham one.

That is most certain.

Such an one is sure to be temperate and the reverse of covetous; for the motives which make another man desirous of having and spending, have no place in his character.

Very true.

Another criterion of the philosophical nature has also to be considered.

What is that?

There should be no secret corner of illiberality; nothing can be more antagonistic than meanness to a soul which is ever longing after the whole of things both divine and human.

Most true, he replied.

Then how can he who has magnificence of mind and is the spectator of all time and all existence, think much of human life?

He cannot.

Or can such an one account death fearful?

No indeed.

Then the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true philosophy?

Certainly not.

Or again: can he who is harmoniously constituted, who is not covetous or mean, or a boaster, or a coward—can he, I say, ever be unjust or hard in his dealings?

Impossible.

Then you will soon observe whether a man is just and gentle, or rude and unsociable; these are the signs which distinguish even in youth the philosophical nature from the unphilosophical.

True.

There is another point which should be remarked.

What point?

Whether he has or has not a pleasure in learning; for no one will love that which gives him pain, and in which after much toil he makes little progress.

Certainly not.

And again, if he is forgetful and retains nothing of what he learns, will he not be an empty vessel?

That is certain.

Labouring in vain, he must end in hating himself and his fruitless occupation? Yes.

Then a soul which forgets cannot be ranked among genuine philosophic natures; we must insist that the philosopher should have a good memory?

Certainly.

And once more, the inharmonious and unseemly nature can only tend to disproportion?

Undoubtedly.

And do you consider truth to be akin to proportion or to disproportion?

To proportion.

Then, besides other qualities, we must try to find a naturally well-proportioned and gracious mind, which will move spontaneously towards the true being of everything.

Certainly.

Well, and do not all these qualities, which we have been enumerating, go together, and are they not, in a manner, necessary to a soul, which is to have a full and perfect participation of being?

They are absolutely necessary, he replied.

And must not that be a blameless study which he only can pursue who has the gift of a good memory, and is quick to learn,—noble, gracious, the friend of truth, justice, courage, temperance, who are his kindred?

The god of jealousy himself, he said, could find no fault with such a study.","在远古的混沌中，宇宙以其无序而玄妙的形态存在着。无极生太极，太极便是阴阳二气的诞生之初。阴阳交替，互相作用，产生了天地万物。这是宇宙生成与变化的根本，亦是万物生生不息的源泉。天地之间，山川海洋、草木虫鱼，无一不在阴阳的包容之内。人类，作为天地间的灵物，更与自然界有着密不可分的联系。

人在天地之间，既有精神亦有形骸。精神，源自上天，是灵魂的象征；形骸，来自大地，是肉体的象征。精神与形骸，如同阴阳二气，既相互独立，又紧密相连。精神主宰人的思维与情感，是生命的源泉；形骸则载负精神，是生命的容器。二者的和谐统一，乃人之健康快乐的重要标志。

然而，人往往迷恋于外在事物，忽视了精神的内在安宁。追求外在的物欲和享乐，使得人们的心志变得混乱，内心的平静与安宁也因此而受到破坏。物质的欲望纷繁复杂，使人的精神处于高度紧张和冲突之中，内心不安，五脏六腑亦会因此受到影响。人的一切情志活动，无不是由精神主导的，物欲的过度追求必定会消耗人的精神，使心志不清，身心疲惫，长期如此，便会导致健康受损，甚至引发各种疾病。

保持精神的内守，是人类避免灾祸侵扰的重要修习。精神的安宁，心志的清明，是生命之健康的必然要求。人的心志，当如山间明泉，清澈见底；如林中翠竹，挺拔修直；如蓝天白云，悠然自得。唯有如此，五脏六腑才能安然无恙，身体才能健康平和。精神和气血的内守与恬静，是人类得以长久健康、不被外界灾祸侵扰的根本所在。

嗜欲与情感，是生活的一部分，但过度的嗜欲和情感活动，无疑会引发精气的耗散。人的精气，如同河流之水，源源不绝，滋养全身，但若无节制地消耗，终将枯竭。从精神与物质的联系来看，精气的耗散，直接损及精神活动，导致心志混乱，难以自控，身体的健康亦会因此而受损。保持适度的情感和物欲，控制内心的欲望，使精神内守，恬静自得，方能使精气充沛，身体强健。

自古以来，圣贤之人，莫不强调精神内守的重要性。庄子曰：“无欲无求，以至于道；心静气和，长寿无疆。”这是对精神内守之道的极致描述。保持精神的内守，就是将心灵的宁静与安详置于首位，不为外界的繁杂所干扰。精神内守之人，心志常清，体魄常健，虽身处红尘纷扰，却如行云流水，飘然物外。

保持精神内守，不仅是个体健康的基础，更是身心和谐、提升自我境界的关键。无论是古代的哲学家，还是当代的心理学家，均一致认为，人若能保持平和的心态，恬静的精神，必能得到长久的健康与幸福。内心的世界，恰如一片宁静的海洋，只有当它不被外界的风浪所扰，才能一直保持清明与安详。

因此，我们应深刻认识到精神内守的重要性。通过静思、冥想、修心养性，可以达到内心的平和安定。不为物欲所动，不为情感所扰，以凝练的心智，应对人生的种种挑战。将灵魂安放于宁静之中，让心灵得到片刻的休憩，方能在纷扰的世间，保持内心的安宁与健康。

总而言之，宇宙的生成与阴阳的交替给了我们关于人与天地自然关系的深刻启示。人的精神与形骸的内在联系，表明了我们必须关注内心的和谐，将精神的内守作为维护健康的首要任务。通过平和的心态、适度的情感以及对物欲的节制，我们可以保持五脏安宁，精气充沛，避免各种因嗜欲过度而导致的灾祸侵扰。精神内守，是我们追求身心和谐、健康长寿的根本要求。",易,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"In this passage, the characters discuss the true nature of philosophers and their suitability as guardians of the State.

I contend not in judgment with Thee, who art the truth; I fear to deceive myself; lest mine iniquity lie unto itself. Therefore I contend not in judgment with Thee; for if Thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall abide it?","宇宙自始无形，混沌初开，无有分际。然而，大道机缘下，阴阳二气相互交织，渐成万物。阴阳二气，乃宇宙万物之根本，乾坤之源，万事万物皆由此而生。天地分离，有了高天与厚土；水火相济，于是有了清泉与泛滥。至此，万物萌发，各得其性，各有其道，并在相互作用中不断演化，以无穷的变化丰富了宇宙的多姿多彩。

人生存于天地之间，始于天地阴阳之和，大地滋养其形，天之气赋其神。人，作为天地之灵物，得天地之精气，生而为灵性之体。天地之气化育，人与自然相生相息。这种关系不仅体现于形骸之互动，更在于精神层面的交融。精神源自上天，形骸源自大地，这种天授之神与地造之形有着内在的联系，协调并平衡着人的生命状态。

在日常的生存与生活中，人常为外物所牵，流连于五色、五音之境，逐利于身外之物。然而，过度追求外在之物，会损害内心精神，使心志迷失，神思涣散。当心神不宁，则五脏六腑无法安宁，身亦不安，灾祸易发，疾患频生。因此，追求身外之物，不止是对物质的浪费，更是对自身精神的伤害。

相反，若能保持精神内守，心志自可清明。精神内守，既是对外物不为所动，亦是关于内心的定守。一心内守者，其心境清澈，宁静致远，不为外界环境所扰，五脏六腑得以和谐，气血流通，身体健康。凡古圣先贤，无不倡导精神内守之道，教导后人以恬静无为、知足常乐为要，避免嗜欲过度、情感无度所带来的身心损害。

精神与形体，是生命的两个重要维度。精气充盈，体态康健；形体振作，精神亦旺。然有时人多不自知，过度耗费精力于外物，忽视内在调养。嗜欲过度，如饮食不节，情感无度，如情绪起伏，皆可导致精气耗散。精气一旦耗散，则五脏失调，内外皆乱，身心受损，健康长寿徒成空谈。

追求精神内守与恬静，不仅是对生命状况的调整，更是对心灵境界的提升。古往今来，先贤所崇尚的修身养性之道，莫不以精神内守为核心。精神内守，不仅能使人心志清明，五脏安宁，更能使人达致超然境界，与天地精神相融，感知宇宙之大道。

因此，修身养性，需重视精神内守，涵养气血，恬淡明志。惟有如此，方能使人体内外平衡，身心康泰，长保健康之态。人生在世，切莫为外物所惑，当以大道为求，明心见性，安身立命。惟精惟一，守中至诚，方能立于天地之间，无愧于天地，安享人生。",易,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage is a heartfelt prayer and reflection on the nature of God and the speaker's relationship with Him.

"But though this splenetic philosophy, which in time of sickness or low spirits is familiar to every man, thus entirely depreciates those great objects of human desire, when in better health and in better humour, we never fail to regard them under a more agreeable aspect. Our imagination, which in pain and sorrow seems to be confined and cooped up within our own persons, in times of ease and prosperity expands itself to every thing around us. We are then charmed with the beauty of that accommodation which reigns in the palaces and œconomy of the great; and admire how every thing is adapted to promote their ease, to prevent their wants, to gratify their wishes, and to amuse and entertain their most frivolous desires. If we consider the real satisfaction which all these things are capable of affording, by itself and separated from the beauty of that arrangement which is fitted to promote it, it will always appear in the highest 245degree contemptible and trifling.

人在天地之间，自有其独特的位置。精神与形骸，正是人类存在的两大要素。精神源自上天，代表了人的理智、思想、灵魂；形骸来自大地，是人的肉体、感官、器官二者互为依存，共同构成人的完整存在。正如天地依靠阴阳二气统一协调，人体也需精神与形体的平衡才能和谐运作。

然而，现代社会中，物质诱惑无处不在，人们常在追求外在之物中迷失自我。追逐名利、财富或一时的快感，这些外在的追求，往往使人偏离内在精神的安宁。精神一旦受扰，心智便不再清明，五脏六腑也逐渐失调，最终引发各种身心疾病。于是我们必须反思，如何在这个纷繁复杂的世界中保持精神的内守。

保持精神内守，就是要避免外物的干扰，回归内心的宁静。这并不是要完全排斥外界事物，而是在面对外界变化时，能保持内心的安定和清明。精神内守，不仅是对外界诱惑的抗拒，更是心志的坚守和信仰的持久。人若能做到精神内守，则心慧宁静、志存高远，不为物欲所动，不为情感所扰，才能真正实现身心的平衡。

此外，精神与气血亦需内守与恬静。古往今来，医学家和哲学家们都强调精神与气血的关系。气血是人体之根，无气则生命不存，无血则身体不立。精神恬静的时候，气血则运行顺畅，脏腑功能自然调和，疾病难侵；反之，若精神躁动，气血必然紊乱，百病滋生。故而，精神内守，乃是养生之道。

最后，我们不得不警示嗜欲和情感过度的危害。嗜欲无度，正如焚膏继晷，消耗的是人体的精气神，终将损害健康。过度的情感纠葛亦是如此，过喜、过怒、过哀、过乐皆非健康之道。情感固然是人生的重要部分，但它们也应有度，过犹不及。现代人应学会调节情绪，保持心理平衡，方能减少精气耗散，维持身体健康。

天地广阔，无尽的阴阳之气浸润着万物，而人作为天地之间的精华，承载着精神与形骸的统一。归根结底，精神内守，不逐外物，是人类追求健康、安宁及和谐生活的永恒主题。我们应时刻铭记这一古老的智慧，并在繁忙的生活中，常怀宁静致远之心，以期平稳度过人生的每一刻。",易,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage discusses how our perceptions of wealth and prosperity vary depending on our state of mind.

"This formula shows us that the act of association comprises a mutual undertaking between the public and the individuals, and that each individual, in making a contract, as we may say, with himself, is bound in a double capacity; as a member of the Sovereign he is bound to the individuals, and as a member of the State to the Sovereign. But the maxim of civil right, that no one is bound by undertakings made to himself, does not apply in this case; for there is a great difference between incurring an obligation to yourself and incurring one to a whole of which you form a part.
Attention must further be called to the fact that public deliberation, while competent to bind all the subjects to the Sovereign, because of the two different capacities in which each of them may be regarded, cannot, for the opposite reason, bind the Sovereign to itself; and that it is consequently against the nature of the body politic for the Sovereign to impose on itself a law which it cannot infringe. Being able to regard itself in only one capacity, it is in the position of an individual who makes a contract with himself; and this makes it clear that there neither is nor can be any kind of fundamental law binding on the body of the people—not even the social contract itself. This does not mean that the body politic cannot enter into undertakings with others, provided the contract is not infringed by them; for in relation to what is external to it, it becomes a simple being, an individual.
But the body politic or the Sovereign, drawing its being wholly from the sanctity of the contract, can never bind itself, even to an outsider, to do anything derogatory to the original act, for instance, to alienate any part of itself, or to submit to another Sovereign. Violation of the act by which it exists would be self-annihilation; and that which is itself nothing can create nothing.
As soon as this multitude is so united in one body, it is impossible to offend against one of the members without attacking the body, and still more to offend against the body without the members resenting it. Duty and interest therefore equally oblige the two contracting parties to give each other help; and the same men should seek to combine, in their double capacity, all the advantages dependent upon that capacity.
Again, the Sovereign, being formed wholly of the individuals who compose it, neither has nor can have any interest contrary to theirs; and consequently the sovereign power need give no guarantee to its subjects, because it is impossible for the body to wish to hurt all its members. We shall also see later on that It cannot hurt any in particular. The Sovereign, merely by virtue of what it is, is is always what it should be.
This, however, is not the case with the relation of the subjects to the Sovereign, which, despite the common interest, would have no security that they would fulfil their undertakings, unless it found means to assure itself of their fidelity.
In fact, each individual, as a man, may have a particular will contrary or dissimilar to the general will which he has as a citizen. His particular interest may speak to him quite differently from the common interest: his absolute and naturally independent existence may make him look upon what he owes to the common cause as a gratuitous contribution, the loss of which will do less harm to others than the payment of it is burdensome to himself; and, regarding the moral person which constitutes the State as a persona ficta, because not a man, he may wish to enjoy the rights of citizenship without being ready to fulfil the duties of a subject. The continuance of such an injustice could not but prove the undoing of the body politic.
In order then that the social compact may not be an empty formula, it tacitly includes the undertaking, which alone can give force to the rest, that whoever refuses to obey the general will shall be compelled to do so by the whole body. This means nothing less than that he will be forced to be free; for this is the condition which, by giving each citizen to his country, secures him against all personal dependence. In this lies the key to the working of the political machine; this alone legitimizes civil undertakings, which, without it, would be absurd, tyrannical, and liable to the most frightful abuses.",宇宙的秘密，总是隐匿于混沌之中，而万象的根源，便是阴阳二气的交互作用。这段哲思并不仅仅囿于抽象的思辨，它深入到了人与天地自然的关系之中，揭示出一种深刻的共生和互依关系。在探讨宇宙生成的过程中，我们看到宇宙从最初的混沌状态中逐渐分化出阴阳二气，而阴阳二气的互相作用，则形成了我们所见的万物，这其中包括了自然界的万物和人类自身。天地自然与人的关系，不仅仅是外在的，更是内在的，这种内在关系正是通过阴阳二气表现出来的。具体而言，人的精神源自于上天，而形骸则源自于大地。这种观点揭示了人类精神和形体之间的内在联系，既承认了二者各自的独特性，也强调了它们之间不可分割的关系。人的精神与天地自然相通，而形骸则与大地相连，这种共生性使得人类在追求外在事物的过程中，如果过分看重身外之物，势必会对内心精神造成损害。精神与形体的联系不仅存在于宏观层面，还细致地体现在人的日常生活和身体健康中。保持精神的内守，是使人心志清明、五脏安宁的关键，这种平衡状态能够避免外界灾祸的侵扰。我们在追求物质的同时，若忽视了精神的安宁，便容易陷入物欲的陷阱中。物欲和情感的过度，都会导致精气的耗散，精气的耗散不仅会损害精神，更会对身体健康产生不良影响。保持精神和气血的内守与恬静，显得尤为重要。这种内在的安宁并不是拒绝外界的事物，而是在面对外界事物时保持一种内在的平衡和安宁。这种平衡能够使我们在应对外界挑战时，保持一种不动心的状态，从而避免内心的混乱和精神的扰动。总之，宇宙的生成和阴阳二气的作用，揭示了人与天地自然的深刻联系。在这种联系中，保持精神的内守和气血的恬静，不仅是自我修养的途径，更是健康生活的基础。这种平衡状态的维护，需要我们在面对物欲和情感时，保持警觉，避免过度。只有在这种内外和谐的状态下，我们才能达到身心的安宁，避免疾病和灾祸的侵扰，真正实现人与自然的和谐共生。,易,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage discusses the nature of the social contract and the relationship between individuals and the Sovereign (the collective body of people forming the state). It explains that each individual, in entering the social contract, is bound in two roles: as a member of the Sovereign and as a member of the State. The Sovereign cannot impose laws on itself but can bind individuals due to their dual capacities. The Sovereign's legitimacy comes from the sanctity of the contract, and it cannot undertake actions that undermine its own existence. The passage highlights the interdependence between the Sovereign and its members, emphasizing that the Sovereign cannot have interests contrary to those of its constituents. However, individual members might have wills that conflict with the general will. To ensure fidelity to the common interest, the social contract includes a provision that compels individuals to adhere to the general will, thereby maintaining the integrity of the body politic and legitimizing civil undertakings.",762
"This formula shows us that the act of association comprises a mutual undertaking between the public and the individuals, and that each individual, in making a contract, as we may say, with himself, is bound in a double capacity; as a member of the Sovereign he is bound to the individuals, and as a member of the State to the Sovereign. But the maxim of civil right, that no one is bound by undertakings made to himself, does not apply in this case; for there is a great difference between incurring an obligation to yourself and incurring one to a whole of which you form a part.
Attention must further be called to the fact that public deliberation, while competent to bind all the subjects to the Sovereign, because of the two different capacities in which each of them may be regarded, cannot, for the opposite reason, bind the Sovereign to itself; and that it is consequently against the nature of the body politic for the Sovereign to impose on itself a law which it cannot infringe. Being able to regard itself in only one capacity, it is in the position of an individual who makes a contract with himself; and this makes it clear that there neither is nor can be any kind of fundamental law binding on the body of the people—not even the social contract itself. This does not mean that the body politic cannot enter into undertakings with others, provided the contract is not infringed by them; for in relation to what is external to it, it becomes a simple being, an individual.
But the body politic or the Sovereign, drawing its being wholly from the sanctity of the contract, can never bind itself, even to an outsider, to do anything derogatory to the original act, for instance, to alienate any part of itself, or to submit to another Sovereign. Violation of the act by which it exists would be self-annihilation; and that which is itself nothing can create nothing.
As soon as this multitude is so united in one body, it is impossible to offend against one of the members without attacking the body, and still more to offend against the body without the members resenting it. Duty and interest therefore equally oblige the two contracting parties to give each other help; and the same men should seek to combine, in their double capacity, all the advantages dependent upon that capacity.
Again, the Sovereign, being formed wholly of the individuals who compose it, neither has nor can have any interest contrary to theirs; and consequently the sovereign power need give no guarantee to its subjects, because it is impossible for the body to wish to hurt all its members. We shall also see later on that It cannot hurt any in particular. The Sovereign, merely by virtue of what it is, is is always what it should be.
This, however, is not the case with the relation of the subjects to the Sovereign, which, despite the common interest, would have no security that they would fulfil their undertakings, unless it found means to assure itself of their fidelity.
In fact, each individual, as a man, may have a particular will contrary or dissimilar to the general will which he has as a citizen. His particular interest may speak to him quite differently from the common interest: his absolute and naturally independent existence may make him look upon what he owes to the common cause as a gratuitous contribution, the loss of which will do less harm to others than the payment of it is burdensome to himself; and, regarding the moral person which constitutes the State as a persona ficta, because not a man, he may wish to enjoy the rights of citizenship without being ready to fulfil the duties of a subject. The continuance of such an injustice could not but prove the undoing of the body politic.
In order then that the social compact may not be an empty formula, it tacitly includes the undertaking, which alone can give force to the rest, that whoever refuses to obey the general will shall be compelled to do so by the whole body.

"The period which intervened between the birth of Pericles and the death of Aristotle, is undoubtedly, whether considered in itself, or with reference to the effects which it has produced upon the subsequent destinies of civilized man, the most memorable in the history of the world. What was the combination of moral and political circumstances which produced so unparalleled a progress during that period in literature and the arts;—why that progress, so rapid and so sustained, so soon received a check, and became retrograde,—are problems left to the wonder and conjecture of posterity. The wrecks and fragments of those subtle and profound minds, like the ruins of a fine statue, obscurely suggest to us the grandeur and perfection of the whole. Their very language—a type of the understandings of which it was the creation and the image—in variety, in simplicity, in flexibility, and in copiousness, excels every other language of the western world. Their sculptures are such as we, in our presumption, assume to be the models of ideal truth and beauty, and to which no artist of modern times can produce forms in any degree comparable. Their paintings, according to Pliny and Pausanias, were full of delicacy and harmony; and some even were powerfully pathetic, so as to awaken, like tender music or tragic poetry, the most overwhelming emotions. We are accustomed to conceive the painters of the sixteenth century, as those who have brought their art to the highest perfection, probably because none of the ancient paintings have been preserved. For all the inventive arts maintain, as it were, a sympathetic connexion between each other, being no more than various expressions of one internal power, modified by different circumstances, either of an individual, or of society; and the paintings of that period would probably bear the same relation as is confessedly borne by the sculptures to all succeeding ones. Of their music we know little; but the effects which it is said to have produced, whether they be attributed to the skill of the composer, or the sensibility of his audience, are far more powerful than any which we experience from the music of our own times; and if, indeed, the melody of their compositions were more tender and delicate, and inspiring, than the melodies of some modern European nations, their superiority in this art must have been something wonderful, and wholly beyond conception.
Their poetry seems to maintain a very high, though not so disproportionate a rank, in the comparison. Perhaps Shakespeare, from the variety and comprehension of his genius, is to be considered, on the whole, as the greatest individual mind, of which we have specimens remaining. Perhaps Dante created imaginations of greater loveliness and energy than any that are to be found in the ancient literature of Greece. Perhaps nothing has been discovered in the fragments of the Greek lyric poets equivalent to the sublime and chivalric sensibility of Petrarch.—But, as a poet. Homer must be acknowledged to excel Shakespeare in the truth, the harmony, the sustained grandeur, the satisfying completeness of his images, their exact fitness to the illustration, and to that to which they belong. Nor could Dante, deficient in conduct, plan, nature, variety, and temperance, have been brought into comparison with these men, but for those fortunate isles laden with golden fruit, which alone could tempt any one to embark in the misty ocean of his dark and extravagant fiction.
But, omitting the comparison of individual minds, which can afford no general inference, how superior was the spirit and system of their poetry to that of any other period! So that had any other genius equal in other respects to the greatest that ever enlightened the world, arisen in that age, he would have been superior to all, from this circumstance alone—that had conceptions would have assumed a more harmonious and perfect form. For it is worthy of observation, that whatever the poet of that age produced is as harmonious and perfect as possible. In a drama, for instance, were the composition of a person of inferior talent, it was still homogeneous and free from inequalities it was a whole, consistent with itself. The compositions of great minds bore throughout the sustained stamp of their greatness. In the poetry of succeeding ages the expectations are often exalted on Icarian wings, and fall, too much disappointed to give a memory and a name to the oblivious pool in which they fell.
In physical knowledge Aristotle and Theophrastus had already—no doubt assisted by the labours of those of their predecessor whom they criticize—made advances worthy of the maturity of science. The astonishing invention of geometry, that series of discoveries which have enabled man to command the element and foresee future events, before the subjects of his ignorant wonder, and which have opened as it were the doors of the mysteries of nature, had already been brought to great perfection. Metaphysics, the science of man's intimate nature, and logic, or the grammar and elementary principles of that science received from the latter philosophers of the Periclean age a firm basis. All our more exact philosophy is built upon the labours of these great men, and many of the words which we employ in metaphysical distinctions were invented by them to give accuracy and system to their reasonings. The science of morals, or the voluntary conduct of men in relation to themselves or others, dates from this epoch. How inexpressibly bolder and more pure were the doctrines of those great men, in comparison with the timid maxims which prevail in the writings of the most esteemed modern moralists! They were such as Phocion, and Epaminondas, and Timoleon, who formed themselves on their influence, were to the wretched heroes of our own age.
Their political and religious institutions are more difficult to bring into comparison with those of other times. A summary idea may be formed of the worth of any political and religious system, by observing the comparative degree of happiness and of intellect produced under its influence. And whilst many institution and opinions, which in ancient Greece were obstacles to the improvement of the human race, have been abolished among modern nations, how many pernicious superstitions and new contrivances of misrule, and unheard-of complications of public mischief, have not been invented among them by the ever-watchful spirit of avarice and tyranny!","在无尽的时空之中，宇宙最原初的状态即为混沌。这种混沌状态中，阴阳二气互相交织，彼此作用，演变出无数可能与形态，最终生成了我们所认知的万物。从宇宙生成之初的这一坯混沌中，我们可以看到阴阳二气的缠绵交织，孕育出了万事万物。这阴阳二气不仅只是力量的对冲，更是天地万物之所以生成的根基和要素。天地万物之间的错综复杂的相互关系，使得世界充满了无尽的变化与生机。人类就置身于这庞大的天地自然之中，人与天地自然的关系由此而变得既密不可分又耐人寻味。

人的精神源自上天，形骸源自大地。上天赐予了人类精神的火花，这火花是生命的核心与本质，是高于一切的存在。而我们的形骸则是大地馈赠的物质，是支撑精神的一具容器。人与天地自然之间，不仅是单纯的物质与能量交换，更是一种微妙的和谐与平衡，精神与形骸就如同阴阳二气，构成了一个完满的人类存在。

在这种和谐之中，精神与形骸的内在联系显得尤为重要。精神离不开形骸的支持，而形骸则因精神的存在而具有了真正的生命。在日常生活中，我们总是依赖于外界的物质和环境，而忽略了内在精神的需求。然而，如果过于追求身外之物，则有可能损害内心的精神，导致精神的错乱与迷失。因此，保持精神的内守，对心志清明、五脏安宁具有重要意义。

追求外物之时，人的心志难以清明，五脏难以安宁，这是因为外物总是引发无尽的欲望与执念，这些欲望与执念不断消耗着我们的精气。人在不知不觉间便陷入了无尽的烦恼与痛苦之中。唯有保持精神的内守，才能使心志清明，五脏安宁。这不仅是一种生存的智慧，更是一种生活的艺术。

保持精神和气血的内守与恬静，一方面使我们能够更好地体会自身的内在状态，另一方面也使我们能更和谐地与外界环境互动。人与天地自然之间的和谐，不仅仅是物质层面的协调，更是精神与气血的整体平衡。内心的平静与稳定能让我们避开因欲望和情感过度所导致的精气耗散，从而维持身体的健康。

欲望和情感过度，是损害健康的根源。嗜欲过度不仅让精神无法宁静，还会使精气迅速耗散，身体也会因此而遭受损伤。情感的波动和欲望的膨胀，一如风暴中的大海，必然会冲击心灵的内守。唯有学会控制嗜欲，调节情感，使精神内守，保持心态的平稳，才能真正护卫我们的健康。

古往今来，哲学家们不断探索人类与宇宙、与自然的关系。这种探索不仅是对外部世界的理解，更是一种对内在精神的省视。在这个过程中，人类逐渐认识到精神的内守与气血的平和，是健康与幸福的根本所在。无论是在哪一个时代，这一认识始终不过时。这不仅仅是一种人生的智慧，而更是一种生活的信仰。

最终，追求内在的宁静，去理解人与天地自然的深刻关系，让精神能够内守，气血得以调和，人类便能够在这庞大的宇宙之中找到自己的位置。这不仅是一种存在的真实，更是智慧的极致。通过理解与实践这样的智慧，我们将在天地自然赋予的时间里，找到真正的平衡和幸福。",易,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage highlights the unparalleled cultural, intellectual, and artistic achievements during the period between the birth of Pericles and the death of Aristotle.

It discusses the extraordinary progress in literature, arts, and sciences, as well as the reasons for its subsequent decline. The passage praises the Greek language, sculptures, and paintings for their excellence and impact. It also compares the poetry of ancient Greece with that of later periods, acknowledging Homer’s superiority while recognizing the merits of Shakespeare and Dante. The advancements in physical knowledge, metaphysics, logic, and morals by figures like Aristotle and Theophrastus are emphasized as foundational to modern sciences and philosophies. Moreover, the passage reflects on Greek political and religious institutions, noting their role in fostering happiness and intellect despite certain obstacles.

"Immanuel Kant is generally regarded as the greatest of the modern philosophers. Though he lived through the Seven Years War and the French Revolution, he never interrupted his teaching of philosophy at Königsberg in East Prussia. His most distinctive contribution was the invention of what he called the 'critical' philosophy, which, assuming as a datum that there is knowledge of various kinds, inquired how such knowledge comes to be possible, and deduced, from the answer to this inquiry, many metaphysical results as to the nature of the world. Whether these results were valid may well be doubted. But Kant undoubtedly deserves credit for two things: first, for having perceived that we have a priori knowledge which is not purely 'analytic', i.e. such that the opposite would be self-contradictory, and secondly, for having made evident the philosophical importance of the theory of knowledge.
Before the time of Kant, it was generally held that whatever knowledge was a priori must be 'analytic'. What this word means will be best illustrated by examples. If I say, 'A bald man is a man', 'A plane figure is a figure', 'A bad poet is a poet', I make a purely analytic judgement: the subject spoken about is given as having at least two properties, of which one is singled out to be asserted of it. Such propositions as the above are trivial, and would never be enunciated in real life except by an orator preparing the way for a piece of sophistry. They are called 'analytic' because the predicate is obtained by merely analysing the subject. Before the time of Kant it was thought that all judgements of which we could be certain a priori were of this kind: that in all of them there was a predicate which was only part of the subject of which it was asserted. If this were so, we should be involved in a definite contradiction if we attempted to deny anything that could be known a priori. 'A bald man is not bald' would assert and deny baldness of the same man, and would therefore contradict itself. Thus according to the philosophers before Kant, the law of contradiction, which asserts that nothing can at the same time have and not have a certain property, sufficed to establish the truth of all a priori knowledge.
Hume (1711-76), who preceded Kant, accepting the usual view as to what makes knowledge a priori, discovered that, in many cases which had previously been supposed analytic, and notably in the case of cause and effect, the connexion was really synthetic. Before Hume, rationalists at least had supposed that the effect could be logically deduced from the cause, if only we had sufficient knowledge. Hume argued—correctly, as would now be generally admitted—that this could not be done. Hence he inferred the far more doubtful proposition that nothing could be known a priori about the connexion of cause and effect. Kant, who had been educated in the rationalist tradition, was much perturbed by Hume's scepticism, and endeavoured to find an answer to it. He perceived that not only the connexion of cause and effect, but all the propositions of arithmetic and geometry, are 'synthetic', i.e. not analytic: in all these propositions, no analysis of the subject will reveal the predicate. His stock instance was the proposition 7 + 5 = 12. He pointed out, quite truly, that 7 and 5 have to be put together to give 12: the idea of 12 is not contained in them, nor even in the idea of adding them together. Thus he was led to the conclusion that all pure mathematics, though a priori, is synthetic; and this conclusion raised a new problem of which he endeavoured to find the solution.
The question which Kant put at the beginning of his philosophy, namely 'How is pure mathematics possible?' is an interesting and difficult one, to which every philosophy which is not purely sceptical must find some answer. The answer of the pure empiricists, that our mathematical knowledge is derived by induction from particular instances, we have already seen to be inadequate, for two reasons: first, that the validity of the inductive principle itself cannot be proved by induction; secondly, that the general propositions of mathematics, such as 'two and two always make four', can obviously be known with certainty by consideration of a single instance, and gain nothing by enumeration of other cases in which they have been found to be true. Thus our knowledge of the general propositions of mathematics (and the same applies to logic) must be accounted for otherwise than our (merely probable) knowledge of empirical generalizations such as 'all men are mortal'.","宇宙万象，无不源自混沌。亿万年前，在那寂静的混沌状态中，阴阳二气破空而出，互相作用，生成了世间万物。阴与阳，象征着对立与和合。这一对立的和谐之中，天地自然秩序井然，而人与天地自然的关系也在此基础上得以建立。阴阳的交替，不仅造就了天地山川、日月星辰，更滋养了生灵万物，其中尤以人为精华之所在。人作为天地之间的产物，其存在本身便是阴阳二气平衡的体现。

人在天地自然中，既有形骸，又有精神。形骸源自大地，精神源于上天。正如古人云，‘形者，有质之谓也；神者，无质之谓也。’形骸是具体的、可触摸的，而精神则是抽象的、不可见的。然而，形体与精神二者却密不可分。精神统领形骸，形骸支撑精神。精神的清明与否直接影响着形骸的健康，形骸的安宁又反过来影响精神的状态。

物质追逐容易让人迷失本心，过多的外在欲望会使人的精神受到损害。追求身外之物，只会让人心神不宁，情绪紊乱，从而五脏受困，百病丛生。反之，若能保持精神的内守与恬静，便可使人心志清明，五脏安宁，远离灾祸。在现代社会，物质文明高度发达，人们在追逐物质享受的同时，往往忽视了内在精神的修养，导致身心失衡，疾病缠身。

保持精神和气血的内守与恬静，是古往今来养生之道。所谓恬静，不是不食人间烟火，而是心态的平和与从容。心神平和，欲望不过度，情感不激烈，便可使精气常驻，健康常在。嗜欲过度，情感波动剧烈，会使精气涣散，神魂颠倒，进而损害健康。

物质的追求是无止境的，而精神的满足则讲求适度。一个人的心灵世界是需要宁静和安宁的，这种宁静正是源于对物质欲望的克制和精神的内守。古人常说‘知足常乐’，知足不仅是一种生活智慧，更是一种养生智慧。恬淡自得，内心安宁，便可远离烦恼，身心健康。

总之，形体与精神的和谐统一，是人健康的保障。内守精神、保持气血的和谐，追求心灵的宁静与通达，才是真正的养生之道。在追求物质的同时，不忘修养精神，才能使心志清明，远离疾患，拥有健康长寿的人生。",易,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"Immanuel Kant is regarded as a pivotal modern philosopher notable for his 'critical' philosophy, which examines how knowledge is possible, resulting in substantial metaphysical implications.

"What, then, is the rightful limit to the sovereignty of the individual over himself? Where does the authority of society begin? How much of human life should be assigned to individuality, and how much to society?
Each will receive its proper share, if each has that which more particularly concerns it. To individuality should belong the part of life in which it is chiefly the individual that is interested; to society, the part which chiefly interests society.
Though society is not founded on a contract, and though no good purpose is answered by inventing a contract in order to deduce social obligations from it, every one who receives the protection of society owes a return for the benefit, and the fact of living in society renders it indispensable that each should be bound to[Pg 141] observe a certain line of conduct towards the rest. This conduct consists, first, in not injuring the interests of one another; or rather certain interests which, either by express legal provision or by tacit understanding, ought to be considered as rights; and secondly, in each person's bearing his share (to be fixed on some equitable principle) of the labours and sacrifices incurred for defending the society or its members from injury and molestation. These conditions society is justified in enforcing, at all costs to those who endeavour to withhold fulfilment. Nor is this all that society may do. The acts of an individual may be hurtful to others, or wanting in due consideration for their welfare, without going the length of violating any of their constituted rights. The offender may then be justly punished by opinion though not by law. As soon as any part of a person's conduct affects prejudicially the interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it, and the question whether the general welfare will or will not be promoted by interfering with it, becomes open to discussion. But there is no room for entertaining any such question when a person's conduct affects the interests of no persons besides himself, or needs not affect them unless they like (all the persons concerned being of full age, and[Pg 142] the ordinary amount of understanding). In all such cases there should be perfect freedom, legal and social, to do the action and stand the consequences.
It would be a great misunderstanding of this doctrine, to suppose that it is one of selfish indifference, which pretends that human beings have no business with each other's conduct in life, and that they should not concern themselves about the well-doing or well-being of one another, unless their own interest is involved. Instead of any diminution, there is need of a great increase of disinterested exertion to promote the good of others. But disinterested benevolence can find other instruments to persuade people to their good, than whips and scourges, either of the literal or the metaphorical sort. I am the last person to undervalue the self-regarding virtues; they are only second in importance, if even second, to the social. It is equally the business of education to cultivate both. But even education works by conviction and persuasion as well as by compulsion, and it is by the former only that, when the period of education is past, the self-regarding virtues should be inculcated. Human beings owe to each other help to distinguish the better from the worse, and encouragement to choose the[Pg 143] former and avoid the latter. They should be for ever stimulating each other to increased exercise of their higher faculties, and increased direction of their feelings and aims towards wise instead of foolish, elevating instead of degrading, objects and contemplations. But neither one person, nor any number of persons, is warranted in saying to another human creature of ripe years, that he shall not do with his life for his own benefit what he chooses to do with it. He is the person most interested in his own well-being: the interest which any other person, except in cases of strong personal attachment, can have in it, is trifling, compared with that which he himself has; the interest which society has in him individually (except as to his conduct to others) is fractional, and altogether indirect: while, with respect to his own feelings and circumstances, the most ordinary man or woman has means of knowledge immeasurably surpassing those that can be possessed by any one else. The interference of society to overrule his judgment and purposes in what only regards himself, must be grounded on general presumptions; which may be altogether wrong, and even if right, are as likely as not to be misapplied to individual cases, by persons no better acquainted with the circumstances of such[Pg 144] cases than those are who look at them merely from without. In this department, therefore, of human affairs, Individuality has its proper field of action. In the conduct of human beings towards one another, it is necessary that general rules should for the most part be observed, in order that people may know what they have to expect; but in each person's own concerns, his individual spontaneity is entitled to free exercise. Considerations to aid his judgment, exhortations to strengthen his will, may be offered to him, even obtruded on him, by others; but he himself is the final judge. All errors which he is likely to commit against advice and warning, are far outweighed by the evil of allowing others to constrain him to what they deem his good.
I do not mean that the feelings with which a person is regarded by others, ought not to be in any way affected by his self-regarding qualities or deficiencies. This is neither possible nor desirable. If he is eminent in any of the qualities which conduce to his own good, he is, so far, a proper object of admiration. He is so much the nearer to the ideal perfection of human nature. If he is grossly deficient in those qualities, a sentiment the opposite of admiration will follow. There is a degree of folly, and a degree of what may be[Pg 145] called (though the phrase is not unobjectionable) lowness or depravation of taste, which, though it cannot justify doing harm to the person who manifests it, renders him necessarily and properly a subject of distaste, or, in extreme cases, even of contempt: a person could not have the opposite qualities in due strength without entertaining these feelings. Though doing no wrong to any one, a person may so act as to compel us to judge him, and feel to him, as a fool, or as a being of an inferior order: and since this judgment and feeling are a fact which he would prefer to avoid, it is doing him a service to warn him of it beforehand, as of any other disagreeable consequence to which he exposes himself. It would be well, indeed, if this good office were much more freely rendered than the common notions of politeness at present permit, and if one person could honestly point out to another that he thinks him in fault, without being considered unmannerly or presuming. We have a right, also, in various ways, to act upon our unfavourable opinion of any one, not to the oppression of his individuality, but in the exercise of ours. We are not bound, for example, to seek his society; we have a right to avoid it (though not to parade the avoidance), for we have a right to choose the society most acceptable to us. We[Pg 146] have a right, and it may be our duty, to caution others against him, if we think his example or conversation likely to have a pernicious effect on those with whom he associates. We may give others a preference over him in optional good offices, except those which tend to his improvement. In these various modes a person may suffer very severe penalties at the hands of others, for faults which directly concern only himself; but he suffers these penalties only in so far as they are the natural, and, as it were, the spontaneous consequences of the faults themselves, not because they are purposely inflicted on him for the sake of punishment. A person who shows rashness, obstinacy, self-conceit—who cannot live within moderate means—who cannot restrain himself from hurtful indulgences—who pursues animal pleasures at the expense of those of feeling and intellect—must expect to be lowered in the opinion of others, and to have a less share of their favourable sentiments; but of this he has no right to complain, unless he has merited their favour by special excellence in his social relations, and has thus established a title to their good offices, which is not affected by his demerits towards himself.",宇宙的诞生与其发展历程，一直是人类探索和研究的重要课题。在早期的哲学思辨中，以“混沌”状态描述了宇宙的初始形态，那是一种充满无序和未分化的状况。在这混沌之中，宇宙诞生了阴阳二气，阴阳二气的相互作用成为万物生成的根本动力。由此可以看到，阴阳理论不仅揭示了宇宙的起源，也解析了自然界和万物的变化规律。这一理论也深入探讨了人与天地自然之间的关系，认为人与自然界是一个整体，相互依存、相互作用。从阴阳相生的哲学观点来看，人类的精神源自于上天，而形骸则来源于大地。精神和形体虽看似两个不同的方面，但实际上存在内在的联系和默契的和谐。这种联系不仅影响人们的身心健康，也决定了人们的生活方式和追求的方向。追求身外之物往往会使人的精神受到损害，因为外在的物质并不能满足内心深处的需求。只要保持精神的内守，人才能心志清明，五脏安宁，远离外界的灾祸侵扰。精神与气血的内守与恬静，是人体健康和内心平和的关键。学会保持精神的内守，并且恬静处世，可以使人心志专一，避免因嗜欲和情感的过度波动而导致精气耗散，进而损害健康。嗜欲和情感的过度，会扰乱心智，导致气血运行不畅，最终伤害人们的身体和精神。因此，克服嗜欲，保持心灵的纯净，平静地面对生活的各种挑战，是每一个追求真理和健康生活的人应当思考的问题。综上所述，从宇宙的诞生到人与天地自然的关系，从精神与形骸的内在联系到精神内守与气血恬静的重要性，这一切都表明：只有在精神与身体和谐统一的状态下，人们才能真正找到内心的平和和生活的幸福。在现代社会中，人们往往追求外部的物质和成就，而忽视了内心的修养和精神的内守。回归到精神与形骸的和谐统一，重新理解和实践自然与人之间的平衡关系，将有助于我们在人生的道路上，找到真正的自我，实现身心的健康与和谐美满。,易,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage discusses the appropriate boundaries between individual sovereignty and societal authority. It posits that individuals should have autonomy over their personal actions unless those actions negatively impact others. Society can enforce rules to ensure individuals do not harm one another and contribute fairly to communal well-being. While society can influence individual behavior through opinion and encouragement, it should not override personal judgment concerning self-regarding actions. Individuals must accept social judgment and suffer natural consequences for personal faults, but coercion should be limited to cases where others are directly affected.

It would be well, indeed, if this good office were much more freely rendered than the common notions of politeness at present permit, and if one person could honestly point out to another that he thinks him in fault, without being considered unmannerly or presuming. We have a right, also, in various ways, to act upon our unfavourable opinion of any one, not to the oppression of his individuality, but in the exercise of ours. We are not bound, for example, to seek his society; we have a right to avoid it (though not to parade the avoidance), for we have a right to choose the society most acceptable to us. We[Pg 147] have a right, and it may be our duty, to caution others against him, if we think his example or conversation likely to have a pernicious effect on those with whom he associates. We may give others a preference over him in optional good offices, except those which tend to his improvement. In these various modes a person may suffer very severe penalties at the hands of others, for faults which directly concern only himself; but he suffers these penalties only in so far as they are the natural, and, as it were, the spontaneous consequences of the faults themselves, not because they are purposely inflicted on him for the sake of punishment. A person who shows rashness, obstinacy, self-conceit—who cannot live within moderate means—who cannot restrain himself from hurtful indulgences—who pursues animal pleasures at the expense of those of feeling and intellect—must expect to be lowered in the opinion of others, and to have a less share of their favourable sentiments; but of this he has no right to complain, unless he has merited their favour by special excellence in his social relations, and has thus established a title to their good offices, which is not affected by his demerits towards himself.",,,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage discusses the appropriate boundaries between individual sovereignty and societal authority.

"What, then, is the rightful limit to the sovereignty of the individual over himself? Where does the authority of society begin? How much of human life should be assigned to individuality, and how much to society?
Each will receive its proper share, if each has that which more particularly concerns it. To individuality should belong the part of life in which it is chiefly the individual that is interested; to society, the part which chiefly interests society.
Though society is not founded on a contract, and though no good purpose is answered by inventing a contract in order to deduce social obligations from it, every one who receives the protection of society owes a return for the benefit, and the fact of living in society renders it indispensable that each should be bound to[Pg 141] observe a certain line of conduct towards the rest. This conduct consists, first, in not injuring the interests of one another; or rather certain interests which, either by express legal provision or by tacit understanding, ought to be considered as rights; and secondly, in each person's bearing his share (to be fixed on some equitable principle) of the labours and sacrifices incurred for defending the society or its members from injury and molestation. These conditions society is justified in enforcing, at all costs to those who endeavour to withhold fulfilment. Nor is this all that society may do. The acts of an individual may be hurtful to others, or wanting in due consideration for their welfare, without going the length of violating any of their constituted rights. The offender may then be justly punished by opinion though not by law. As soon as any part of a person's conduct affects prejudicially the interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it, and the question whether the general welfare will or will not be promoted by interfering with it, becomes open to discussion. But there is no room for entertaining any such question when a person's conduct affects the interests of no persons besides himself, or needs not affect them unless they like (all the persons concerned being of full age, and[Pg 142] the ordinary amount of understanding). In all such cases there should be perfect freedom, legal and social, to do the action and stand the consequences.
It would be a great misunderstanding of this doctrine, to suppose that it is one of selfish indifference, which pretends that human beings have no business with each other's conduct in life, and that they should not concern themselves about the well-doing or well-being of one another, unless their own interest is involved. Instead of any diminution, there is need of a great increase of disinterested exertion to promote the good of others. But disinterested benevolence can find other instruments to persuade people to their good, than whips and scourges, either of the literal or the metaphorical sort. I am the last person to undervalue the self-regarding virtues; they are only second in importance, if even second, to the social. It is equally the business of education to cultivate both. But even education works by conviction and persuasion as well as by compulsion, and it is by the former only that, when the period of education is past, the self-regarding virtues should be inculcated. Human beings owe to each other help to distinguish the better from the worse, and encouragement to choose the[Pg 143] former and avoid the latter. They should be for ever stimulating each other to increased exercise of their higher faculties, and increased direction of their feelings and aims towards wise instead of foolish, elevating instead of degrading, objects and contemplations. But neither one person, nor any number of persons, is warranted in saying to another human creature of ripe years, that he shall not do with his life for his own benefit what he chooses to do with it. He is the person most interested in his own well-being: the interest which any other person, except in cases of strong personal attachment, can have in it, is trifling, compared with that which he himself has; the interest which society has in him individually (except as to his conduct to others) is fractional, and altogether indirect: while, with respect to his own feelings and circumstances, the most ordinary man or woman has means of knowledge immeasurably surpassing those that can be possessed by any one else. The interference of society to overrule his judgment and purposes in what only regards himself, must be grounded on general presumptions; which may be altogether wrong, and even if right, are as likely as not to be misapplied to individual cases, by persons no better acquainted with the circumstances of such[Pg 144] cases than those are who look at them merely from without. In this department, therefore, of human affairs, Individuality has its proper field of action. In the conduct of human beings towards one another, it is necessary that general rules should for the most part be observed, in order that people may know what they have to expect; but in each person's own concerns, his individual spontaneity is entitled to free exercise. Considerations to aid his judgment, exhortations to strengthen his will, may be offered to him, even obtruded on him, by others; but he himself is the final judge. All errors which he is likely to commit against advice and warning, are far outweighed by the evil of allowing others to constrain him to what they deem his good.
I do not mean that the feelings with which a person is regarded by others, ought not to be in any way affected by his self-regarding qualities or deficiencies. This is neither possible nor desirable. If he is eminent in any of the qualities which conduce to his own good, he is, so far, a proper object of admiration. He is so much the nearer to the ideal perfection of human nature. If he is grossly deficient in those qualities, a sentiment the opposite of admiration will follow. There is a degree of folly, and a degree of what may be[Pg 145] called (though the phrase is not unobjectionable) lowness or depravation of taste, which, though it cannot justify doing harm to the person who manifests it, renders him necessarily and properly a subject of distaste, or, in extreme cases, even of contempt: a person could not have the opposite qualities in due strength without entertaining these feelings.

"No moral Principles so clear and so generally received as the forementioned speculative Maxims.
If those speculative Maxims, whereof we discoursed in the foregoing chapter, have not an actual universal assent from all mankind, as we there proved, it is much more visible concerning PRACTICAL Principles, that they come short of an universal reception: and I think it will be hard to instance any one moral rule which can pretend to so general and ready an assent as, “What is, is”; or to be so manifest a truth as this, that “It is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be.” Whereby it is evident that they are further removed from a title to be innate; and the doubt of their being native impressions on the mind is stronger against those moral principles than the other. Not that it brings their truth at all in question. They are equally true, though not equally evident. Those speculative maxims carry their own evidence with them: but moral principles require reasoning and discourse, and some exercise of the mind, to discover the certainty of their truth. They lie not open as natural characters engraved on the mind; which, if any such were, they must needs be visible by themselves, and by their own light be certain and known to everybody. But this is no derogation to their truth and certainty; no more than it is to the truth or certainty of the three angles of a triangle being equal to two right ones because it is not so evident as “the whole is bigger than a part,” nor so apt to be assented to at first hearing. It may suffice that these moral rules are capable of demonstration: and therefore it is our own faults if we come not to a certain knowledge of them. But the ignorance wherein many men are of them, and the slowness of assent wherewith others receive them, are manifest proofs that they are not innate, and such as offer themselves to their view without searching.
Faith and Justice not owned as Principles by all Men.
Whether there be any such moral principles, wherein all men do agree, I appeal to any who have been but moderately conversant in the history of mankind, and looked abroad beyond the smoke of their own chimneys. Where is that practical truth that is universally received, without doubt or question, as it must be if innate? JUSTICE, and keeping of contracts, is that which most men seem to agree in. This is a principle which is thought to extend itself to the dens of thieves, and the confederacies of the greatest villains; and they who have gone furthest towards the putting off of humanity itself, keep faith and rules of justice one with another. I grant that outlaws themselves do this one amongst another: but it is without receiving these as the innate laws of nature. They practise them as rules of convenience within their own communities: but it is impossible to conceive that he embraces justice as a practical principle who acts fairly with his fellow-highwayman, and at the same time plunders or kills the next honest man he meets with. Justice and truth are the common ties of society; and therefore even outlaws and robbers, who break with all the world besides, must keep faith and rules of equity amongst themselves; or else they cannot hold together. But will any one say, that those that live by fraud or rapine have innate principles of truth and justice which they allow and assent to?
Objection: though Men deny them in their Practice, yet they admit them in their Thoughts answered.
Perhaps it will be urged, that the tacit assent of their minds agrees to what their practice contradicts. I answer, first, I have always thought the actions of men the best interpreters of their thoughts. But, since it is certain that most men’s practices, and some men’s open professions, have either questioned or denied these principles, it is impossible to establish an universal consent, (though we should look for it only amongst grown men,) without which it is impossible to conclude them innate. Secondly, it is very strange and unreasonable to suppose innate practical principles, that terminate only in contemplation. Practical principles, derived from nature, are there for operation, and must produce conformity of action, not barely speculative assent to their truth, or else they are in vain distinguished from speculative maxims. Nature, I confess, has put into man a desire of happiness and an aversion to misery: these indeed are innate practical principles which (as practical principles ought) DO continue constantly to operate and influence all our actions without ceasing: these may be observed in all persons and all ages, steady and universal; but these are INCLINATIONS OF THE APPETITE to good, not impressions of truth on the understanding.

"No moral Principles so clear and so generally received as the forementioned speculative Maxims.
If those speculative Maxims, whereof we discoursed in the foregoing chapter, have not an actual universal assent from all mankind, as we there proved, it is much more visible concerning PRACTICAL Principles, that they come short of an universal reception: and I think it will be hard to instance any one moral rule which can pretend to so general and ready an assent as, “What is, is”; or to be so manifest a truth as this, that “It is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be.” Whereby it is evident that they are further removed from a title to be innate; and the doubt of their being native impressions on the mind is stronger against those moral principles than the other. Not that it brings their truth at all in question. They are equally true, though not equally evident. Those speculative maxims carry their own evidence with them: but moral principles require reasoning and discourse, and some exercise of the mind, to discover the certainty of their truth. They lie not open as natural characters engraved on the mind; which, if any such were, they must needs be visible by themselves, and by their own light be certain and known to everybody. But this is no derogation to their truth and certainty; no more than it is to the truth or certainty of the three angles of a triangle being equal to two right ones because it is not so evident as “the whole is bigger than a part,” nor so apt to be assented to at first hearing. It may suffice that these moral rules are capable of demonstration: and therefore it is our own faults if we come not to a certain knowledge of them. But the ignorance wherein many men are of them, and the slowness of assent wherewith others receive them, are manifest proofs that they are not innate, and such as offer themselves to their view without searching.
Faith and Justice not owned as Principles by all Men.
Whether there be any such moral principles, wherein all men do agree, I appeal to any who have been but moderately conversant in the history of mankind, and looked abroad beyond the smoke of their own chimneys. Where is that practical truth that is universally received, without doubt or question, as it must be if innate? JUSTICE, and keeping of contracts, is that which most men seem to agree in. This is a principle which is thought to extend itself to the dens of thieves, and the confederacies of the greatest villains; and they who have gone furthest towards the putting off of humanity itself, keep faith and rules of justice one with another. I grant that outlaws themselves do this one amongst another: but it is without receiving these as the innate laws of nature. They practise them as rules of convenience within their own communities: but it is impossible to conceive that he embraces justice as a practical principle who acts fairly with his fellow-highwayman, and at the same time plunders or kills the next honest man he meets with. Justice and truth are the common ties of society; and therefore even outlaws and robbers, who break with all the world besides, must keep faith and rules of equity amongst themselves; or else they cannot hold together. But will any one say, that those that live by fraud or rapine have innate principles of truth and justice which they allow and assent to?
Objection: though Men deny them in their Practice, yet they admit them in their Thoughts answered.
Perhaps it will be urged, that the tacit assent of their minds agrees to what their practice contradicts. I answer, first, I have always thought the actions of men the best interpreters of their thoughts. But, since it is certain that most men’s practices, and some men’s open professions, have either questioned or denied these principles, it is impossible to establish an universal consent, (though we should look for it only amongst grown men,) without which it is impossible to conclude them innate. Secondly, it is very strange and unreasonable to suppose innate practical principles, that terminate only in contemplation. Practical principles, derived from nature, are there for operation, and must produce conformity of action, not barely speculative assent to their truth, or else they are in vain distinguished from speculative maxims. Nature, I confess, has put into man a desire of happiness and an aversion to misery: these indeed are innate practical principles which (as practical principles ought) DO continue constantly to operate and influence all our actions without ceasing: these may be observed in all persons and all ages, steady and universal; but these are INCLINATIONS OF THE APPETITE to good, not impressions of truth on the understanding. I deny not that there are natural tendencies imprinted on the minds of men; and that from the very first instances of sense and perception, there are some things that are grateful and others unwelcome to them; some things that they incline to and others that they fly: but this makes nothing for innate characters on the mind, which are to be the principles of knowledge regulating our practice.

As regards materialistic atomism, it is one of the best-refuted theories that have been advanced, and in Europe there is now perhaps no one in the learned world so unscholarly as to attach serious signification to it, except for convenient everyday use (as an abbreviation of the means of expression)—thanks chiefly to the Pole Boscovich: he and the Pole Copernicus have hitherto been the greatest and most successful opponents of ocular evidence. For while Copernicus has persuaded us to believe, contrary to all the senses, that the earth does NOT stand fast, Boscovich has taught us to abjure the belief in the last thing that ""stood fast"" of the earth—the belief in ""substance,"" in ""matter,"" in the earth-residuum, and particle-atom: it is the greatest triumph over the senses that has hitherto been gained on earth. One must, however, go still further, and also declare war, relentless war to the knife, against the ""atomistic requirements"" which still lead a dangerous after-life in places where no one suspects them, like the more celebrated ""metaphysical requirements"": one must also above all give the finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism which Christianity has taught best and longest, the SOUL-ATOMISM.

Psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down the instinct of self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic being.

It is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that natural philosophy is only a world-exposition and world-arrangement (according to us, if I may say so!) and NOT a world-explanation; but in so far as it is based on belief in the senses, it is regarded as more, and for a long time to come must be regarded as more—namely, as an explanation. It has eyes and fingers of its own, it has ocular evidence and palpableness of its own: this operates fascinatingly, persuasively, and CONVINCINGLY upon an age with fundamentally plebeian tastes—in fact, it follows instinctively the canon of truth of eternal popular sensualism. What is clear, what is ""explained""? Only that which can be seen and felt—one must pursue every problem thus far. Obversely, however, the charm of the Platonic mode of thought, which was an ARISTOCRATIC mode, consisted precisely in RESISTANCE to obvious sense-evidence—perhaps among men who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious senses than our contemporaries, but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining masters of them: and this by means of pale, cold, grey conceptional networks which they threw over the motley whirl of the senses—the mob of the senses, as Plato said. In this overcoming of the world, and interpreting of the world in the manner of Plato, there was an ENJOYMENT different from that which the physicists of today offer us—and likewise the Darwinists and anti-teleologists among the physiological workers, with their principle of the ""smallest possible effort,"" and the greatest possible blunder.

It has eyes and fingers of its own, it has ocular evidence and palpableness of its own: this operates fascinatingly, persuasively, and CONVINCINGLY upon an age with fundamentally plebeian tastes—in fact, it follows instinctively the canon of truth of eternal popular sensualism. What is clear, what is ""explained""? Only that which can be seen and felt—one must pursue every problem thus far. Obversely, however, the charm of the Platonic mode of thought, which was an ARISTOCRATIC mode, consisted precisely in RESISTANCE to obvious sense-evidence—perhaps among men who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious senses than our contemporaries, but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining masters of them: and this by means of pale, cold, grey conceptional networks which they threw over the motley whirl of the senses—the mob of the senses, as Plato said. In this overcoming of the world, and interpreting of the world in the manner of Plato, there was an ENJOYMENT different from that which the physicists of today offer us—and likewise the Darwinists and anti-teleologists among the physiological workers, with their principle of the ""smallest possible effort,"" and the greatest possible blunder. ""Where there is nothing more to see or to grasp, there is also nothing more for men to do""—that is certainly an imperative different from the Platonic one, but it may notwithstanding be the right imperative for a hardy, laborious race of machinists and bridge-builders of the future, who have nothing but ROUGH work to perform.
To study physiology with a clear conscience, one must insist on the fact that the sense-organs are not phenomena in the sense of the idealistic philosophy; as such they certainly could not be causes! Sensualism, therefore, at least as regulative hypothesis, if not as heuristic principle. What? And others say even that the external world is the work of our organs? But then our body, as a part of this external world, would be the work of our organs! But then our organs themselves would be the work of our organs! It seems to me that this is a complete REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM, if the conception CAUSA SUI is something fundamentally absurd. Consequently, the external world is NOT the work of our organs—?",,,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage critiques Kantian philosophy and materialistic atomism, advocating instead for a new understanding of synthetic judgments a priori and the nature of the soul. The author argues that synthetic a priori judgments are false but necessary for human preservation. He criticizes traditional atomistic beliefs, particularly those concerning the soul, proposing instead a concept of the soul as mortal and composed of subjective multiplicities. The passage also discusses the limitations of natural philosophy, emphasizing that it serves more as an arrangement of the world rather than an explanation, and contrasts this with Platonic thought which values intellectual triumph over sensory evidence. Finally, the author repudiates the notion that the external world is a mere product of our sensory organs, labeling this idea as logically flawed.",1157
