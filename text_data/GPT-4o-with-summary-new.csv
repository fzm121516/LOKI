我已经记不清那时怎样地将我的纯真热烈的爱表示给她。岂但现在，那时的事后便已模胡，夜间回想，早只剩了一些断片了；同居以后一两月，便连这些断片也 化作无可追踪的梦影。我只记得那时以前的十几天，曾经很仔细地研究过表示的态度，排列过措辞的先后，以及倘或遭了拒绝以后的情形。可是临时似乎都无用，在 慌张中，身不由己地竟用了在电影上见过的方法了。后来一想到，就使我很愧恧，但在记忆上却偏只有这一点永远留遗，至今还如暗室的孤灯一般，照见我含泪握着 她的手，一条腿跪了下去……。不但我自己的，便是子君的言语举动，我那时就没有看得分明；仅知道她已经允许我了。但也还仿佛记得她脸色*变成青白，后来又渐渐转作绯红，——没有见 过，也没有再见的绯红；孩子似的眼里射出悲喜，但是夹着惊疑的光，虽然力避我的视线，张皇地似乎要破窗飞去。然而我知道她已经允许我了，没有知道她怎样说 或是没有说。她却是什么都记得：我的言辞，竟至于读熟了的一般，能够滔滔背诵；我的举动，就如有一张我所看不见的影片挂在眼下，叙述得如生，很细微，自然连那使我 不愿再想的浅薄的电影的一闪。夜阑人静，是相对温习的时候了，我常是被质问，被考验，并且被命复述当时的言语，然而常须由她补足，由她纠正，像一个丁等的 学生。这温习后来也渐渐稀疏起来。但我只要看见她两眼注视空中，出神似的凝想着，于是神色*越加柔和，笑窝也深下去，便知道她又在自修旧课了，只是我很怕她看到我那可笑的电影的一闪。但我又知道，她一定要看见，而且也非看不可的。,,,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字描述了作者回忆起与子君表示爱意时的情景。尽管作者对当时的细节记得模糊，但子君却记得很清楚，包括他的言辞和举动。子君会在夜阑人静时相对温习这些旧事，甚至考验作者重述当时的情景，使作者感到愧疚和尴尬。,636

当我沉默着的时候，我觉得充实；我将开口，同时感到空虚。过去的生命已经死亡。我对于这死亡有大欢喜，因为我借此知道它曾经存活。死亡的生命已经朽腐。我对于这朽腐有大欢喜，因为我借此知道它还非空虚。 生命的泥委弃在地面上，不生乔木，只生野草，这是我的罪过。野草，根本不深，花叶不美，然而吸取露，吸取水，吸取陈死人的血和肉，各各夺取它的生存。当生存时，还是将遭践踏，将遭删刈，直至于死亡而朽腐。 但我坦然，欣然。我将大笑，我将歌唱。我自爱我的野草，但我憎恶这以野草作装饰的地面。地火在地下运行，奔突；熔岩一旦喷出，将烧尽一切野草，以及乔木，于是并且无可朽腐。但我坦然，欣然。 我将大笑，我将歌唱。天地有如此静穆，我不能大笑而且歌唱。天地即不如此静穆，我或者也将不能。我以这一丛野草， 在明与暗，生与死，过去与未来之际，献于友与仇，人与兽，爱者与不爱者之前作证。 为我自己，为友与仇，人与兽，爱者与不爱者，我希望这野草的朽腐，火速到来。要不然，我先就未曾生存，这实在比死亡与朽腐更其不幸。 去罢，野草，连着我的题辞！,"在一个深夜，我独自坐在书桌前，沉思着生命的意义。窗外的风轻轻吹过，带来一阵凉意，仿佛在提醒我生命的短暂与无常。我内心深处涌动着一股难以言喻的矛盾情绪。在沉默中，我往往能找到一种内心的充实感，仿佛这沉默是我灵魂的避风港。然而，每当我试图用言语表达自己的思想时，却感到内心空虚，仿佛言语剥离了我的真实感受，留下的只有虚无。

我回想起自己过去的生命，那些已经死亡和腐朽的岁月，虽已消逝，但我从中获得了一种奇特的欣慰。腐朽意味着曾经的存在，那些过往的时光，虽已不再鲜活，却在我心中留下了不可磨灭的印记。

我常常将自己的生命比作一株野草，虽渺小、不美，却顽强地生长在这片广袤的土地上。野草不畏风雨，不惧严寒，纵然最终会被岁月侵蚀，化为尘土，但在这短暂的时光里，它曾经存在过，这对我而言已足够。面对生命的朽腐与毁灭，我坦然接受，甚至带着某种期待。

然而，我对当前的生活状态感到不满，那种无力与空虚像是无尽的深渊，吞噬着我的灵魂。我希望，像那株野草一样，我的生命能够在明暗、生死、过去与未来之间挣扎并留下痕迹。我甚至希望这种朽腐能早日到来，结束这无尽的煎熬，化为泥土，为新生的野草提供养分，见证生命的轮回。",,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字表达了一种对生命和死亡的深刻思考。作者在沉默中感到充实，但在言语中感到空虚，反思过去的生命已消逝，并因其曾存在而感到欣慰。死亡带来朽腐，朽腐意味着生命曾真实存在过。作者将自身比作野草，虽然无人欣赏，却执着生存，但终将被命运践踏直到消亡。尽管如此，作者坦然面对，愿在静穆天地间大笑歌唱，希望以野草的朽腐作证，证明在明暗、生死、过去与未来之间的存在，并希望这腐朽早日到来，因为没有真正活过比死亡更为不幸。,456

"我家的后面有一个很大的园，相传叫作“百草园”。现在是早已并屋子一起卖给朱文公的子孙了，连那最末次的相见也已经隔了七八年，其中似乎确凿只有一些野草；但那时却是我的乐园。

不必说碧绿的菜畦，光滑的石井栏，高大的皂荚树，紫红的桑椹；也不必说鸣蝉在树叶里长吟，肥胖的黄蜂伏在菜花上，轻捷的叫天子(云雀)忽然从草间直窜向云霄里去了。单是周围的短短的泥墙根一带，就有无限趣味。油蛉在这里低唱，蟋蟀们在这里弹琴。翻开断砖来，有时会遇见蜈蚣；还有斑蝥，倘若用手指按住它的脊梁，便会拍的一声，从后窍喷出一阵烟雾。何首乌藤和木莲藤缠络着，木莲有莲房一般的果实，何首乌有臃肿的根。有人说，何首乌根是有像人形的，吃了便可以成仙，我于是常常拔它起来，牵连不断地拔起来，也曾因此弄坏了泥墙，却从来没有见过有一块根像人样。如果不怕刺，还可以摘到覆盆子，像小珊瑚珠攒成的小球，又酸又甜，色味都比桑椹要好得远。

长的草里是不去的，因为相传这园里有一条很大的赤练蛇。

长妈妈曾经讲给我一个故事听：先前，有一个读书人住在古庙里用功，晚间，在院子里纳凉的时候，突然听到有人在叫他。答应着，四面看时，却见一个美女的脸露在墙头上，向他一笑，隐去了。他很高兴，但竟给那走来夜谈的老和尚识破了机关。说他脸上有些妖气，一定遇见“美女蛇”了；这是人首蛇身的怪物，能唤人名，倘一答应，夜间便要来吃这人的肉的。他自然吓得要死，而那老和尚却道无妨，给他一个小盒子，说只要放在枕边，便可高枕而卧。他虽然照样办，却总是睡不着，──当然睡不着的。到半夜，果然来了，沙沙沙！门外像是风雨声。他正抖作一团时，却听得“豁”的一声，一道金光从枕边飞出，外面便什么声音也没有了，那金光也就飞回来，敛在盒子里。后来呢？后来，老和尚说，这是飞蜈蚣，它能吸蛇的脑髓，美女蛇就被它治死了。

结末的教训是：所以倘有陌生的声音叫你的名字，你万不可答应他。

这故事很使我觉得做人之险，夏夜乘凉，往往有些担心，不敢去看墙上，而且极想得到一盒老和尚那样的飞蜈蚣。走到百草园的草丛旁边时，也常常这样想。但直到现在，总还是没有得到，但也没有遇见过赤练蛇和美女蛇。叫我名字的陌生声音自然是常有的，然而都不是美女蛇。",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字描述了作者童年时的乐园——百草园的美好景象，详细描绘了园中的植物和动物，以及园中泥墙根一带的趣味。此外，作者还叙述了长妈妈讲述的一个关于美女蛇的故事，并表达了自己夏夜乘凉时因听到陌生声音而产生的担忧和想要得到飞蜈蚣的心情。,923

"那天下午，曼璐的母亲打电话来，把从前那小大姐阿宝的地址告诉她。曼璐从前没有用阿宝，原是因为鸿才常喜欢跟她搭讪，曼璐觉得有点危险性。现在情形不同了，她倒又觉得身边有阿宝这样一个人也好，或者可以拉得住鸿才。她没想到鸿才今非昔比，这样一个小大姐，他哪里放在眼里。
当下她把阿宝的地址记了下来，她母亲道：“昨天你二妹回来，说你好了些了。”曼璐道：“是好多了。等我好了我来看妈。”她本来说要请她母亲来住两天，现在也不提了，也是因为她妹妹的关系，她想还是疏远一点的好。虽然这桩事完全不怪她妹妹，更不与她母亲相干，她在电话上说话的口吻却有点冷淡，也许是不自觉的。顾太太虽然不是一个爱多心的人，但是女儿现在太阔了，贫富悬殊，有些地方就不能不多着点心。当下便道：“好，你一好了就来玩，奶奶也惦记着你呢。”
自从这一次通过电话，顾太太一连好两个月也没去探望女儿。曼璐也一直没有和他们通音信。这一天她到市区里来买东西，顺便弯到娘家来看看。她好久没回来过了，坐着一辆特大特长的最新型汽车，看衖堂的和一些邻人都站在那里看着，也可以算是衣锦荣归了。她的弟弟们在衖堂里学骑脚踏车，一个青年替他们扶着车子，曼桢也站在后门口，抱着胳膊倚在门上看着。曼璐跳下汽车，曼桢笑道：“咦，姊姊来了！”
那青年听见这称呼，似乎非常注意，掉转目光向曼璐这边看来，然而曼璐的眼睛像闪电似的，也正在那里打量着他，他的眼神没有她那样足，敌不过她，急忙望到别处去了。他所得到的印象只是一个穿着皮大衣的中年太太。原来曼璐现在力争上游，为了配合她的身份地位，已经放弃了她的舞台化妆，假睫毛，眼黑，大红的胭脂，一概不用了。她不知道她这样正是自动地缴了械。时间是残酷的，在她这个年龄，浓妆艳抹固然更显憔悴，但是，突然打扮成一个中年妇人的模样，也只有更像一个中年妇人。
曼璐本来还不觉得，今天到绸缎店去买衣料，她把一块紫红色的拿起来看看，正考虑间，那不识相的伙计却极力推荐一块深蓝色的，说：“是您自己穿吗？这蓝的好，大方。”曼璐心里很生气，想道：“你当我是个老太太吗？我倒偏要买那块红的！”虽然赌气买了下来，心里却很不高兴。
今天她母亲也不高兴，因为她的小弟弟杰民把腿摔伤了。曼璐上楼去，她母亲正在那里替杰民包扎膝部。曼璐道：“嗳呀，怎么摔得这样厉害？”顾太太道：“怪他自己呀！一定要学着骑车，我就知道要闯祸！有了这部车子，就都发了疯似的，你也骑我也骑！”曼璐道：“这自行车是新买的么？”顾太太道：“是你大弟弟说，他那学堂太远了，每天乘电车去，还是骑车合算。一直就想要一部自行车，我可是没给他买。新近沈先生买了一部送给他。”说到这里，她把眉毛紧紧蹙了起来。世钧送他们一辆脚踏车，她当时是很高兴的，可是现在因为心疼孩子，不免就迁怒到世钧身上去了。",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字讲述了曼璐在母亲的建议下联系了从前的小大姐阿宝，并因为丈夫的原因决定重新用阿宝。曼璐与母亲通话时口气有些冷淡，她母亲虽然感到女儿的变化，但依然关心她。之后，曼璐去市区买东西，顺便回娘家探望，感受到时间和身份的变化带给自己的冲击。在娘家，曼璐看到弟弟们在学骑自行车，知道小弟弟杰民因为骑车摔伤，母亲对这个情况很不高兴，并迁怒于送车的沈先生。,1154
"那天下午，曼璐的母亲打电话来，把从前那小大姐阿宝的地址告诉她。曼璐从前没有用阿宝，原是因为鸿才常喜欢跟她搭讪，曼璐觉得有点危险性。现在情形不同了，她倒又觉得身边有阿宝这样一个人也好，或者可以拉得住鸿才。她没想到鸿才今非昔比，这样一个小大姐，他哪里放在眼里。
当下她把阿宝的地址记了下来，她母亲道：“昨天你二妹回来，说你好了些了。”曼璐道：“是好多了。等我好了我来看妈。”她本来说要请她母亲来住两天，现在也不提了，也是因为她妹妹的关系，她想还是疏远一点的好。虽然这桩事完全不怪她妹妹，更不与她母亲相干，她在电话上说话的口吻却有点冷淡，也许是不自觉的。顾太太虽然不是一个爱多心的人，但是女儿现在太阔了，贫富悬殊，有些地方就不能不多着点心。当下便道：“好，你一好了就来玩，奶奶也惦记着你呢。”
自从这一次通过电话，顾太太一连好两个月也没去探望女儿。曼璐也一直没有和他们通音信。这一天她到市区里来买东西，顺便弯到娘家来看看。她好久没回来过了，坐着一辆特大特长的最新型汽车，看衖堂的和一些邻人都站在那里看着，也可以算是衣锦荣归了。她的弟弟们在衖堂里学骑脚踏车，一个青年替他们扶着车子，曼桢也站在后门口，抱着胳膊倚在门上看着。曼璐跳下汽车，曼桢笑道：“咦，姊姊来了！”

"虞姬的心在绞痛，当她看见项王倔强的嘴唇转成了白色，他的眼珠发出冷冷的玻璃一样的光辉，那双眼睛向前瞪着的神气是那样的可怕，使她忍不住用她宽大的袖子去掩住它。她能够觉得他的睫毛在她的掌心急促地翼翼扇动，她又觉得一串冰凉的泪珠从她手里一直滚到她的臂弯里，这是她第一次知道那英雄的叛徒也是会流泪的动物。

"这次，我看到了草原。那里的天比别处的更可爱，空气是那么清鲜，天空是那么明朗，使我总想高歌一曲，表示我满心的愉快。在天底下，一碧千里，而并不茫茫。四面都有小丘，平地是绿的，小丘也是绿的。羊群一会儿上了小丘，一会儿又下来，走在哪里都像给无边的绿毯绣上了白色的大花。
那些小丘的线条是那么柔美，就像只用绿色渲染，不用墨线勾勒的中国画那样，到处翠色欲流，轻轻流入云际。这种境界，既使人惊叹，又叫人舒服，既愿久立四望，又想坐下低吟一首奇丽的小诗。在这境界里，连骏马和大牛都有时候静立不动，好像回味着草原的无限乐趣。

走了许久，远远地望见了一条迂回的明如玻璃的带子——河！牛羊多起来，也看到了马群，隐隐有鞭子的轻响。快了，快到了。忽然，像被一阵风吹来似的，远处的小丘上出现了一群马，马上的男女老少穿着各色的衣裳，群马疾驰，襟飘带舞，像一条彩虹向我们飞过来。
这是主人来到几十里外欢迎远客。见到我们，主人们立刻拨转马头，欢呼着，飞驰着，在汽车左右与前面引路。静寂的草原热闹起来：欢呼声，车声，马蹄声，响成一片。车跟着马飞过小丘，看见了几座蒙古包。",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,本文描述了作者在草原上的经历和所见所感。草原的天空明朗，空气清新，一碧千里，绿草如茵，羊群如白色的花点缀其间。小丘线条柔美似中国画，景色令人惊叹和愉悦。访问的地点是陈巴尔虎旗，汽车行驶了一百五十里，全是草原。途中见到河流、牛羊和马群。最终，主人们骑马迎接远客，草原变得热闹起来，最终看到了蒙古包。,583

"母亲的娘家是在北平德胜门外，土城儿外边，通大钟寺的大路上的一个小村里。村里一共有四五家人家，都姓马。大家都种点不十分肥美的土地，但是与我同辈的兄弟们，也有当兵的，作木匠的，作泥水匠的，和当巡察的。他们虽然是农家，却养不起牛马，人手不够的时候，妇女便也须下地作活。

对于姥姥家，我只知道上述的一点。外公外婆是什么样子，我就不知道了，因为他们早已去世。至于更远的族系与家史，就更不晓得了；穷人只能顾眼前的衣食，没有功夫谈论什么过去的光荣：“家谱”这字眼，我在幼年就根本没有听说过。

母亲生在农家，所以勤俭诚实，身体也好。这一点事实却极重要，因为假若我没有这样的一位母亲，我之为我恐怕也就要大大的打个折扣了。

母亲出嫁大概是很早，因为我的大姐现在已是六十多岁的老太婆，而我的大甥女还长我一岁啊。我有三个哥哥，四个姐姐，但能长大成人的，只有大姐，二姐，三哥与我。我是“老”儿子。生我的时候，母亲已四十一岁，大姐二姐已都出了阁。

由大姐与二姐所嫁入的家庭来推断，在我生下之前，我的家里，大概还马马虎虎的过得去。那时候定婚讲究门当户对，而大姐丈是作小官的，二姐丈也开过一间酒馆，他们都是相当体面的人。

可是，我，我给家庭带来了不幸：我生下来，母亲晕过去半夜，才睁眼看见她的老儿子——感谢大姐，把我揣在怀里，致未冻死。

一岁半，我把父亲“克”死了。兄不到十岁，三姐十二三岁，我才一岁半，全仗母亲独力抚养了。父亲的寡姐跟我们一块儿住，她吸鸦片，她喜摸纸牌，她的脾气极坏。为我们的衣食，母亲要给人家洗衣服，缝补或裁缝衣裳。在我的记忆中，她的手终年是鲜红微肿的。白天，她洗衣服，洗一两大绿瓦盆。她作事永远丝毫也不敷衍，就是屠户们送来的黑如铁的布袜，她也给洗得雪白。晚间，她与三姐抱着一盏油灯，还要缝补衣服，一直到半夜。她终年没有休息，可是在忙碌中她还把院子屋中收拾得清清爽爽。桌椅都是旧的，柜门的铜活久已残缺不全，可是她的手老使破桌面上没有尘土，残破的铜活发着光。院中，父亲遗留下的几盆石榴与夹竹桃，永远会得到应有的浇灌与爱护，年年夏天开许多花。

哥哥似乎没有同我玩耍过。有时候，他去读书；有时候，他去学徒；有时候，他也去卖花生或樱桃之类的小东西。母亲含着泪把他送走，不到两天，又含着泪接他回来。我不明白这都是什么事，而只觉得与他很生疏。与母亲相依如命的是我与三姐。因此，她们作事，我老在后面跟着。她们浇花，我也张罗着取水；她们扫地，我就撮土……从这里，我学得了爱花，爱清洁，守秩序。这些习惯至今还被我保存着。

姑母时常闹脾气。她单在鸡蛋里找骨头。她是我家中的阎王。直到我入中学，她才死去，我可是没有看见母亲反抗过。“没受过婆婆的气，还不受大姑子的吗？命当如此！”母亲在非解释一下不足以平服别人的时候，才这样说。是的，命当如此。母亲活到老，穷到老，辛苦到老，全是命当如此。她最会吃亏。给亲友邻居帮忙，她总跑在前面：她会给婴儿洗三——穷朋友们可以因此少花一笔“请姥姥”钱——她会刮痧，她会给孩子们剃头，她会给少妇们绞脸……凡是她能做的，都有求必应。但是，吵嘴打架，永远没有她。她宁吃亏，不逗气。当姑母死去的时候，母亲似乎把一世的委屈都哭了出来，一直哭到坟地。不知道哪里来的一位侄子，声称有承继权，母亲便一声不响，教他搬走那些破桌烂板凳，而且把姑母养的一只肥肉鸡也送给他。",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字讲述了母亲在北平一个小村庄的艰苦生活经历。作者描述了母亲出身农家，勤俭诚实，并在父亲早逝后独力养育家庭的艰辛。母亲不仅勤勉工作，还教会了作者许多良好习惯。尽管生活贫困，母亲仍热情好客，乐于助人，并且从未与人争吵。与姑母的矛盾和母亲在姑母去世后的反应，也展现了母亲一生的忍耐和无私。,1549
"母亲的娘家是在北平德胜门外，土城儿外边，通大钟寺的大路上的一个小村里。村里一共有四五家人家，都姓马。大家都种点不十分肥美的土地，但是与我同辈的兄弟们，也有当兵的，作木匠的，作泥水匠的，和当巡察的。他们虽然是农家，却养不起牛马，人手不够的时候，妇女便也须下地作活。

对于姥姥家，我只知道上述的一点。外公外婆是什么样子，我就不知道了，因为他们早已去世。至于更远的族系与家史，就更不晓得了；穷人只能顾眼前的衣食，没有功夫谈论什么过去的光荣：“家谱”这字眼，我在幼年就根本没有听说过。

母亲生在农家，所以勤俭诚实，身体也好。这一点事实却极重要，因为假若我没有这样的一位母亲，我之为我恐怕也就要大大的打个折扣了。

母亲出嫁大概是很早，因为我的大姐现在已是六十多岁的老太婆，而我的大甥女还长我一岁啊。我有三个哥哥，四个姐姐，但能长大成人的，只有大姐，二姐，三哥与我。我是“老”儿子。生我的时候，母亲已四十一岁，大姐二姐已都出了阁。

由大姐与二姐所嫁入的家庭来推断，在我生下之前，我的家里，大概还马马虎虎的过得去。那时候定婚讲究门当户对，而大姐丈是作小官的，二姐丈也开过一间酒馆，他们都是相当体面的人。

可是，我，我给家庭带来了不幸：我生下来，母亲晕过去半夜，才睁眼看见她的老儿子——感谢大姐，把我揣在怀里，致未冻死。

一岁半，我把父亲“克”死了。兄不到十岁，三姐十二三岁，我才一岁半，全仗母亲独力抚养了。父亲的寡姐跟我们一块儿住，她吸鸦片，她喜摸纸牌，她的脾气极坏。为我们的衣食，母亲要给人家洗衣服，缝补或裁缝衣裳。在我的记忆中，她的手终年是鲜红微肿的。白天，她洗衣服，洗一两大绿瓦盆。她作事永远丝毫也不敷衍，就是屠户们送来的黑如铁的布袜，她也给洗得雪白。晚间，她与三姐抱着一盏油灯，还要缝补衣服，一直到半夜。她终年没有休息，可是在忙碌中她还把院子屋中收拾得清清爽爽。桌椅都是旧的，柜门的铜活久已残缺不全，可是她的手老使破桌面上没有尘土，残破的铜活发着光。院中，父亲遗留下的几盆石榴与夹竹桃，永远会得到应有的浇灌与爱护，年年夏天开许多花。

哥哥似乎没有同我玩耍过。有时候，他去读书；有时候，他去学徒；有时候，他也去卖花生或樱桃之类的小东西。母亲含着泪把他送走，不到两天，又含着泪接他回来。我不明白这都是什么事，而只觉得与他很生疏。与母亲相依如命的是我与三姐。因此，她们作事，我老在后面跟着。她们浇花，我也张罗着取水；她们扫地，我就撮土……从这里，我学得了爱花，爱清洁，守秩序。这些习惯至今还被我保存着。

"其实，当初坚持要去撒哈拉沙漠的人是我，而不是荷西。
后来长期留了下来，又是为了荷西，不是为了我。我的半生，飘流过很多国家。高度文明的社会，我住过，看透，也尝够了，我的感动不是没有，我的生活方式，多多少少也受到它们的影响。但是我始终没有在一个固定的地方，将我的心也留下来给我居住的城市。
不记得在哪一年以前，我无意间翻到了一本美国的《国家地理杂志》，那期书里，它正好在介绍撒哈拉沙漠。我只看了一遍，我不能解释的，属于前世回忆似的乡愁，就莫名其妙，毫无保留的交给了那一片陌生的大地。
等我再回到西班牙来定居时，因为撒哈拉沙漠还有一片二十八万平方公里的地方，是西国的属地，我怀念渴想往它奔去的欲·望就又一度在苦痛着我了。
这种情怀，在我认识的人里面，几乎被他们视为一个笑话。
我常常说，我要去沙漠走一趟，却没有人当我是在说真的。
也有比较了解我的朋友，他们又将我的向往沙漠，解释成看破红尘，自我放逐，一去不返也——这些都不是很正确的看法。
等我给自己排好时间，预备去沙漠住一年时，除了我的父亲鼓励我之外，另外只有一个朋友，他不笑话我，也不阻止我，更不拖累我。他，默默的收拾了行李，先去沙漠的磷矿公司找到了事，安定下来，等我单独去非洲时好照顾我。他知道我是个一意孤行的倔强女子，我不会改变计划的。
在这个人为了爱情去沙漠里受苦时，我心里已经决定要跟他天涯海角一辈子流浪下去了。
那个人，就是我现在的丈夫荷西。",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字描述了作者的心路历程以及她与丈夫荷西的关系。作者对撒哈拉沙漠有一种无法解释的眷恋，这种情怀源于她翻阅《国家地理杂志》后对撒哈拉的向往。尽管她的这种想法被周围的人认为是笑话或自我放逐，但她仍坚定不移地追求。最终，只有荷西理解并支持她，并且在撒哈拉沙漠磷矿公司找到工作，等待作者到来以照顾她。于是，作者决定跟随荷西流浪，二人携手共度一生。,609

"北平的洋车夫有许多派：年轻力壮，腿脚灵利的，讲究赁漂亮的车，拉“整天儿”，爱什么时候出车与收车都有自由；拉出车来，在固定的“车口”①或宅门一放，专等坐快车的主儿；弄好了，也许一下子弄个一块两块的；碰巧了，也许白耗一天，连“车份儿”也没着落，但也不在乎。这一派哥儿们的希望大概有两个：或是拉包车；或是自己买上辆车，有了自己的车，再去拉包月或散座就没大关系了，反正车是自己的。

比这一派岁数稍大的，或因身体的关系而跑得稍差点劲的，或因家庭的关系而不敢白耗一天的，大概就多数的拉八成新的车；人与车都有相当的漂亮，所以在要价儿的时候也还能保持住相当的尊严。这派的车夫，也许拉“整天”，也许拉“半天”。在后者的情形下，因为还有相当的精气神，所以无论冬天夏天总是“拉晚儿”②。夜间，当然比白天需要更多的留神与本事；钱自然也多挣一些。

年纪在四十以上，二十以下的，恐怕就不易在前两派里有个地位了。他们的车破，又不敢“拉晚儿”，所以只能早早的出车，希望能从清晨转到午后三四点钟，拉出“车份儿”和自己的嚼谷①。他们的车破，跑得慢，所以得多走路，少要钱。到瓜市，果市，菜市，去拉货物，都是他们；钱少，可是无须快跑呢。

在这里，二十岁以下的——有的从十一二岁就干这行儿——很少能到二十岁以后改变成漂亮的车夫的，因为在幼年受了伤，很难健壮起来。他们也许拉一辈子洋车，而一辈子连拉车也没出过风头。那四十以上的人，有的是已拉了十年八年的车，筋肉的衰损使他们甘居人后，他们渐渐知道早晚是一个跟头会死在马路上。他们的拉车姿式，讲价时的随机应变，走路的抄近绕远，都足以使他们想起过去的光荣，而用鼻翅儿扇着那些后起之辈。可是这点光荣丝毫不能减少将来的黑暗，他们自己也因此在擦着汗的时节常常微叹。不过，以他们比较另一些四十上下岁的车夫，他们还似乎没有苦到了家。这一些是以前决没想到自己能与洋车发生关系，而到了生和死的界限已经不甚分明，才抄起车把来的。被撤差的巡警或校役，把本钱吃光的小贩，或是失业的工匠，到了卖无可卖，当无可当的时候，咬着牙，含着泪，上了这条到死亡之路。这些人，生命最鲜壮的时期已经卖掉，现在再把窝窝头变成的血汗滴在马路上。没有力气，没有经验，没有朋友，就是在同行的当中也得不到好气儿。他们拉最破的车，皮带不定一天泄多少次气；一边拉着人还得一边儿央求人家原谅，虽然十五个大铜子儿已经算是甜买卖。

此外，因环境与知识的特异，又使一部分车夫另成派别。生于西苑海甸的自然以走西山，燕京，清华，较比方便；同样，在安定门外的走清河，北苑；在永定门外的走南苑……这是跑长趟的，不愿拉零座；因为拉一趟便是一趟，不屑于三五个铜子的穷凑了。可是他们还不如东交民巷的车夫的气儿长，这些专拉洋买卖①的讲究一气儿由交民巷拉到玉泉山，颐和园或西山。气长也还算小事，一般车夫万不能争这项生意的原因，大半还是因为这些吃洋饭的有点与众不同的知识，他们会说外国话。英国兵，法国兵，所说的万寿山，雍和宫，“八大胡同”，他们都晓得。他们自己有一套外国话，不传授给别人。他们的跑法也特别，四六步儿不快不慢，低着头，目不旁视的，贴着马路边儿走，带出与世无争，而自有专长的神气。因为拉着洋人，他们可以不穿号坎，而一律的是长袖小白褂，白的或黑的裤子，裤筒特别肥，脚腕上系着细带；脚上是宽双脸千层底青布鞋；干净，利落，神气。一见这样的服装，别的车夫不会再过来争座与赛车，他们似乎是属于另一行业的。",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字描述了北平的洋车夫的不同群体和他们的工作状况和生活习惯。文章将洋车夫大致分为几类：年轻力壮、腿脚灵活的车夫，他们通常租漂亮的车子，工作时间自由，有望通过拉包车或者拥有自己的车来增加收入；次一类是稍年长或因家庭和身体原因而不能冒风险浪费一天时间的车夫，他们也拉相对新车，可以选择拉全天或半天的活；年纪更长或更年轻的车夫则大多拉破旧的车子，主要是拉货物，工作时间从清晨到下午。还有一部分车夫因为生活所迫，被迫从事这份工作，他们没有经验和体力，收入最低。最后是一些因特殊环境和知识而形成的独特群体，如专拉洋买卖的车夫，他们常拉外国客人并掌握一些外语，有着特别的穿着和跑法，这让他们看起来像是另一行业的人。,1417

在这里，二十岁以下的——有的从十一二岁就干这行儿——很少能到二十岁以后改变成漂亮的车夫的，因为在幼年受了伤，很难健壮起来。他们也许拉一辈子洋车，而一辈子连拉车也没出过风头。那四十以上的人，有的是已拉了十年八年的车，筋肉的衰损使他们甘居人后，他们渐渐知道早晚是一个跟头会死在马路上。他们的拉车姿式，讲价时的随机应变，走路的抄近绕远，都足以使他们想起过去的光荣，而用鼻翅儿扇着那些后起之辈。可是这点光荣丝毫不能减少将来的黑暗，他们自己也因此在擦着汗的时节常常微叹。不过，以他们比较另一些四十上下岁的车夫，他们还似乎没有苦到了家。这一些是以前决没想到自己能与洋车发生关系，而到了生和死的界限已经不甚分明，才抄起车把来的。被撤差的巡警或校役，把本钱吃光的小贩，或是失业的工匠，到了卖无可卖，当无可当的时候，咬着牙，含着泪，上了这条到死亡之路。这些人，生命最鲜壮的时期已经卖掉，现在再把窝窝头变成的血汗滴在马路上。没有力气，没有经验，没有朋友，就是在同行的当中也得不到好气儿。他们拉最破的车，皮带不定一天泄多少次气；一边拉着人还得一边儿央求人家原谅，虽然十五个大铜子儿已经算是甜买卖。

此外，因环境与知识的特异，又使一部分车夫另成派别。生于西苑海甸的自然以走西山，燕京，清华，较比方便；同样，在安定门外的走清河，北苑；在永定门外的走南苑……这是跑长趟的，不愿拉零座；因为拉一趟便是一趟，不屑于三五个铜子的穷凑了。可是他们还不如东交民巷的车夫的气儿长，这些专拉洋买卖①的讲究一气儿由交民巷拉到玉泉山，颐和园或西山。气长也还算小事，一般车夫万不能争这项生意的原因，大半还是因为这些吃洋饭的有点与众不同的知识，他们会说外国话。英国兵，法国兵，所说的万寿山，雍和宫，“八大胡同”，他们都晓得。他们自己有一套外国话，不传授给别人。他们的跑法也特别，四六步儿不快不慢，低着头，目不旁视的，贴着马路边儿走，带出与世无争，而自有专长的神气。因为拉着洋人，他们可以不穿号坎，而一律的是长袖小白褂，白的或黑的裤子，裤筒特别肥，脚腕上系着细带；脚上是宽双脸千层底青布鞋；干净，利落，神气。一见这样的服装，别的车夫不会再过来争座与赛车，他们似乎是属于另一行业的。",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字描述了北平的洋车夫的不同群体和他们的工作状况和生活习惯。文章将洋车夫大致分为几类：年轻力壮、腿脚灵活的车夫，他们通常租漂亮的车子，工作时间自由，有望通过拉包车或者拥有自己的车来增加收入；次一类是稍年长或因家庭和身体原因而不能冒风险浪费一天时间的车夫，他们也拉相对新车，可以选择拉全天或半天的活；年纪更长或更年轻的车夫则大多拉破旧的车子，主要是拉货物，工作时间从清晨到下午。还有一部分车夫因为生活所迫，被迫从事这份工作，他们没有经验和体力，收入最低。最后是一些因特殊环境和知识而形成的独特群体，如专拉洋买卖的车夫，他们常拉外国客人并掌握一些外语，有着特别的穿着和跑法，这让他们看起来像是另一行业的人。,1417
"现在我才想到，当年我总是独自跑到地坛去，曾经给母亲出了一个怎样的难。

她不是那种光会疼爱儿子而不懂得理解儿子的母亲。她知道我心里的苦闷，知道不该阻止我出去走走，知道我要是老呆在家里结果会更糟，但她又担心我一个人在那荒僻的园子里整天都想些什么。我那时脾气坏到极点，经常是发了疯一样地离开家，从那园子里回来又中了魔似的什么话都不说。母亲知道有些事不宜问，便犹犹豫豫地想问而终于不敢问，因为她自己心里也没有答案。她料想我不会愿意她限我一同去，所以她从未这样要求过，她知道得给我一点独处的时间，得有这样一段过程。她只是不知道这过程得要多久，和这过程的尽头究竟是什么。每次我要动身时，她便无言地帮我准备，帮助我上了轮椅车，看着我摇车拐出小院；这以后她会怎样，当年我不曾想过。

有一回我摇车出了小院；想起一件什么事又返身回来，看见母亲仍站在原地，还是送我走时的姿势，望着我拐出小院去的那处墙角，对我的回来竟一时没有反应。待她再次送我出门的时候，她说：“出去活动活动，去地坛看看书，我说这挺好。”许多年以后我才渐渐听出，母亲这话实际上是自我安慰，是暗自的祷告，是给我的提示，是恳求与嘱咐。只是在她猝然去世之后，我才有余暇设想。当我不在家里的那些漫长的时间，她是怎样心神不定坐卧难宁，兼着痛苦与惊恐与一个母亲最低限度的祈求。现在我可以断定，以她的聪慧和坚忍，在那些空落的白天后的黑夜，在那不眠的黑夜后的白天，她思来想去最后准是对自己说：“反正我不能不让他出去，未来的日子是他自己的，如果他真的要在那园子里出了什么事，这苦难也只好我来承担。”在那段日子里——那是好几年长的一段日子，我想我一定使母亲作过了最坏的准备了，但她从来没有对我说过：“你为我想想”。事实上我也真的没为她想过。那时她的儿子，还太年轻，还来不及为母亲想，他被命运击昏了头，一心以为自己是世上最不幸的一个，不知道儿子的不幸在母亲那儿总是要加倍的。她有一个长到二十岁上忽然截瘫了的儿子，这是她唯一的儿子；她情愿截瘫的是自己而不是儿子，可这事无法代替；她想，只要儿子能活下去哪怕自己去死呢也行，可她又确信一个人不能仅仅是活着，儿子得有一条路走向自己的幸福；而这条路呢，没有谁能保证她的儿子终于能找到。——这样一个母亲，注定是活得最苦的母亲。

有一次与一个作家朋友聊天，我问他学写作的最初动机是什么？他想了一会说：“为我母亲。为了让她骄傲。”我心里一惊，良久无言。回想自己最初写小说的动机，虽不似这位朋友的那般单纯，但如他一样的愿望我也有，且一经细想，发现这愿望也在全部动机中占了很大比重。这位朋友说：“我的动机太低俗了吧？”我光是摇头，心想低俗并不见得低俗，只怕是这愿望过于天真了。他又说：“我那时真就是想出名，出了名让别人羡慕我母亲。”我想，他比我坦率。我想，他又比我幸福，因为他的母亲还活着。而且我想，他的母亲也比我的母亲运气好，他的母亲没有一个双腿残废的儿子，否则事情就不这么简单。

在我的头一篇小说发表的时候，在我的小说第一次获奖的那些日子里，我真是多么希望我的母亲还活着。我便又不能在家里呆了，又整天整天独自跑到地坛去，心里是没头没尾的沉郁和哀怨，走遍整个园子却怎么也想不通：母亲为什么就不能再多活两年？为什么在她儿子就快要碰撞开一条路的时候，她却忽然熬不住了？莫非她来此世上只是为了替儿子担忧，却不该分享我的一点点快乐？她匆匆离我去时才只有四十九呀！有那么一会，我甚至对世界对上帝充满了仇恨和厌恶。后来我在一篇题为“合欢树”的文章中写道：“我坐在小公园安静的树林里，闭上眼睛，想，上帝为什么早早地召母亲回去呢？很久很久，迷迷糊溯的我听见了回答：”她心里太苦了，上帝看她受不住了，就召她回去。‘我似乎得了一点安慰，睁开眼睛，看见风正从树林里穿过。“小公园，指的也是地坛。
只是到了这时候，纷纭的往事才在我眼前幻现得清晰，母亲的苦难与伟大才在我心中渗透得深彻。上帝的考虑，也许是对的。

摇着轮椅在园中慢慢走，又是雾罩的清晨，又是骄阳高悬的白昼，我只想着一件事：母亲已经不在了。在老柏树旁停下，在草地上在颓墙边停下，又是处处虫鸣的午后，又是乌儿归巢的傍晚，我心里只默念着一句话：可是母亲已经不在了。把椅背放倒，躺下，似睡非睡挨到日没，坐起来，心神恍惚，呆呆地直坐到古祭坛上落满黑暗然后再渐渐浮起月光，心里才有点明白，母亲不能再来这园中找我了。
曾有过好多回，我在这园子里呆得太久了，母亲就来找我。她来找我又不想让我发觉，只要见我还好好地在这园子里，她就悄

悄转身回去，我看见过几次她的背影。我也看见过几回她四处张望的情景，她视力不好，端着眼镜像在寻找海上的一条船，她没看见我时我已经看见她了，待我看见她也看见我了我就不去看她，过一会我再抬头看她就又看见她缓缓离去的背影。我单是无法知道有多少回她没有找到我。有一回我坐在矮树丛中，树丛很密，我看见她没有找到我；她一个人在园子里走，走过我的身旁，走过我经常呆的一些地方，步履茫然又急迫。我不知道她已经找了多久还要找多久，我不知道为什么我决意不喊她——但这绝不是小时候的捉迷藏，这也许是出于长大了的男孩子的倔强或羞涩？但这倔只留给我痛侮，丝毫也没有骄傲。我真想告诫所有长大了的男孩子，千万不要跟母亲来这套倔强，羞涩就更不必，我已经懂了可我已经来不及了。

儿子想使母亲骄傲，这心情毕竟是太真实了，以致使“想出名”这一声名狼藉的念头也多少改变了一点形象。这是个复杂的问题，且不去管它了罢。随着小说获奖的激动逐日暗淡，我开始相信，至少有一点我是想错了：我用纸笔在报刊上碰撞开的一条路，并不就是母亲盼望我找到的那条路。年年月月我都到这园子里来，年年月月我都要想，母亲盼望我找到的那条路到底是什么。

母亲生前没给我留下过什么隽永的哲言，或要我恪守的教诲，只是在她去世之后，她艰难的命运，坚忍的意志和毫不张扬的爱，随光阴流转，在我的印象中愈加鲜明深刻。

有一年，十月的风又翻动起安详的落叶，我在园中读书，听见两个散步的老人说：“没想到这园子有这么大。”我放下书，想，这么大一座园子，要在其中找到她的儿子，母亲走过了多少焦灼的路。多年来我头一次意识到，这园中不单是处处都有过我的车辙，有过我的车辙的地万也都有过母亲的脚印。",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字描写了作者在地坛独自生活的岁月里，母亲对他充满关怀和担忧的心情。作者描述了母亲在他外出时无言的支持和内心的痛苦，以及她在作者截瘫后所承受的巨大心理负担。母亲因操劳和担忧去世后，作者回忆母亲的爱和牵挂，感叹自己当时的年少无知和母亲的伟大与坚忍。最终，作者意识到他努力写作取得的成就，并不是母亲真正期盼的道路，他在园子里不断反思母亲的愿望，体悟到母爱深沉复杂的情感。,2535

回来洗了手，桌上已摆好了三个凉菜，又开启了几瓶罐头，庄之蝶自然坐了上席。夏捷喝自带的桂花稠酒，孟云房只享用杏仁果露，周敏就捧满盅白酒敬道：“庄老师，您是西京名人，更是咱潼关人的骄傲，学生蒙您关照到了编辑部，这恩德终生不敢忘的。今日我要说的，是为了去编辑部，其中有些做法不妥，假借了您的名分写条儿，还望老师谅解。至于写您的那篇文章，我才学着写的，让您见笑了。”庄之蝶说：“事情已经办成了，就不必那么说了。那篇文章我也没看，现在写这样文章的人多，虽说是宣传我，可也是人家的文章。以前有人写了让我看，我看了主张不发表，可人家最后还是发表了，写文章的人都有发表欲嘛，所以后来这类文章我都不看。”周敏说：“老师这么大度，真是意想不到，那就受学生一敬，满喝了吧！”之蝶接过仰脖喝了，说：“孟哥你真的戒了？”孟云房说：“当然戒了。”庄之蝶说，“这何必呢？咱们学习佛呀道呀的，主要是从哲学美学方面去借鉴些东西罢了，别降格到民间老太太那样的烧香磕头。其实寺庙里的那些和尚、尼姑也是一种职业。”孟云房说：”这你就不懂了，不在局中，不知局情。练气功不戒酒肉葱蒜，气感就不上身；有了功能，吃酒肉葱蒜又不舒服。”庄之蝶说：“修炼修炼，世上真正的高人都是修出来的，只有徒子徒孙才整日练的。”唐宛儿嗤嗤发笑，众人看她时，却抿了抿嘴，拧头看窗外的那株梨树，梨树举着满枝绿叶，弯曲苍老的身子上有一个洞。庄之蝶看见唐宛儿神情很美，问道：“你要说什么的？”唐宛儿说：“你们说学问的，我听个热闹。”孟云房说：“什么学问！我们常抬杠惯了，我现在越来越和他想不到一块了。”庄之蝶说：“我是觉得你爱走极端化，说戒酒就戒了，这意志我做不到。可滴酒就不沾了？这可是真正的‘五粮液’哩！”孟云房说：“是茅台，也不喝的！”夏捷已经自个喝了一碗稠酒，又喊周敏倒了一碗，说：“之蝶你才说对了，他一生就是吃了走极端的亏！你来西京时，他已出了名的，可这些年了，你一片煌辉灿烂了，他还是他。现在文章也写得少了，整日价参佛呀，练功呀，不吃这不吃那，也害得我寡汤寡水的肚里没有了油！”周敏说：“这就叫孟老师没口福。世上那些个体户做生意的，福而不贵；孟老师贵而不福。”孟云房说：“这话是对的，你庄老师福贵双全，活到这个份上，要啥有啥地风光！”庄之蝶听了，定睛看从窗棂里射进来照在菜盘上的光柱，光柱里有活活的物浮动，脸上就是一丝苦笑，说：“是什么都有了，可我需要破缺。”孟云房一怔，问道：“你说什么？”庄之蝶又重复了一遍：“破缺。”孟云房说：“我现在也难吃摸透你了。说实话，你能去啤酒厂那么长的时间我没有想到，近日在报纸上写的那些文章似乎观念也大不同了以前。”庄之蝶说：“我也吃惊过我自己，是顺应了社会，还是在堕落了。”孟云房说：“这我不能结论，怕就像我怎么迷上气功要戒酒戒肉一样吧，一切都是生命的自然流动，如水加热后必然会出现对称破缺的自组织现象。”两个人这么说着，周敏和唐宛儿就听得似懂非懂，虽然还在笑着，笑得僵硬。夏捷就啧啧啧地咂着口舌，说：“孟云房同志，今日是被人请了来吃酒的，不是开学术会，你们别贩卖那些名词。”庄之蝶就挥挥手，说：“不说了不说了，咱们喝酒吧。”端起杯自个就喝了。,,,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,文字叙述了一群朋友聚餐的情景。庄之蝶、孟云房、周敏、夏捷和唐宛儿在饭桌上进行了一些讨论和交流。周敏感谢庄之蝶的关照并敬酒道歉，孟云房提到自己戒酒戒肉的原因缘于练气功，庄之蝶表示不赞同走极端。夏捷和周敏评论了孟云房的生活选择，认为他过于极端。最后，庄之蝶反思自己是否顺应了社会还是在堕落，引发了与孟云房关于生命自然流动的讨论。,1309

"巍巍大唐就在前面不远处了，中国，从哪条道路走近它？

很多学者认为，顺着中国文化的原路走下去，就成，迟早能到。

我不同意这种看法，因为事实并不是这样。

走向大唐，需要一股浩荡之气。这气，秦汉帝国曾经有过，尤其在秦始皇和汉武帝身上。但是，秦始皇耗于重重内斗和庞大工程，汉武帝耗于五十余年与匈奴的征战，元气散佚。到了后来骄奢无度又四分五裂的乱世，更是气息奄奄。尽管有魏晋名士、王羲之、陶渊明他们延续着高贵的精神脉络，但是，越高贵也就越隐秘，越不能呼应天下。

这种状态，怎么缔造得了一个大唐？

浩荡之气来自于一种强大的力量。这种力量已经无法从宫廷和文苑产生，只能来自于旷野。

旷野之力，也就是未曾开化的蛮力。未曾开化的蛮力能够参与创建一个伟大的文化盛世吗？这就要看它能不能快速地自我开化。如果它能做到，那么，旷野之力也就可能成为支撑整个文明的脊梁。

中国，及时地获得了这种旷野之力。

二

这种旷野之力，来自大兴安岭北部的东麓。

一个仍然处于原始游牧状态的民族——鲜卑族，其中拓跋氏一支渐有起色。当匈奴在汉武帝的征战下西迁和南移之后，鲜卑拓跋氏来到匈奴故地，以强势与匈奴余部联盟，战胜其他部落，称雄北方，建立王朝，于公元四世纪后期定都于今天的山西大同，当时叫平城。根据一位汉族士人的提议，正式改国号为“魏”，表明已经承接三国魏氏政权而进入中华正统，史称北魏。此后，又经过半个世纪的征战，北魏完成了黄河流域的统一。

胜利，以及胜利后统治范围的扩大，使北魏的鲜卑族首领们不得不投入文化思考。

最明显的问题是：汉族被战胜了，可以任意驱使，但汉族所代表的农耕文明，却不能按游牧文明的规则来任意驱使。要有效地领导农耕文明，必然要抑制豪强兼并，实行均田制、户籍制、赋税制、州郡制，而这些制度又牵动着一系列生活方式和文化形态的重大改革。

要么不改革，让中原沃土废耕为牧，一起走回原始时代；要么改革，让被战胜者的文化来战胜自己，共同走向文明。
鲜卑族的智者们勇敢地选择了后者。这在他们自己内部，当然阻力重重。自大而又脆弱的民族防范心理，一次次变成野蛮的凶杀。有些在他们那里做官的汉人也死得很惨，如崔浩。但是，天佑鲜卑，天佑北魏，天佑中华，这条血迹斑斑的改革之路终于通向了一个结论：汉化！

从公元五世纪后期开始，经由冯太后，到孝文帝拓跋宏，开始实行一系列强有力的汉化措施。先在行政制度、农耕制度上动手，然后快速地把改革推向文化。

孝文帝拓跋宏发布了一系列属于文化范畴的严厉命令。

第一，把首都从山西大同（平城）南迁到河南洛阳。理由是北方的故土更适合游牧式的“武功”，而南方的中原大地更适合“文治”。而所谓“文治”，也就是全面采用汉人的社会管理模式。

第二，禁说鲜卑族的语言，一律改说汉语。年长的官员可以允许有一个适应过程，而三十岁以下的鲜卑族官员如果还说鲜卑话，立即降职处分。

第三，放弃鲜卑民族的传统服饰，颁行按汉民族服饰制定的衣帽样式。

第四，迁到洛阳的鲜卑人，一律把自己的籍贯定为“河南洛阳”，死后葬于洛阳北边的邙山。

第五，改鲜卑部落的名号为汉语单姓。

第六，以汉族礼制改革鲜卑族的原始祭祀形式。

第七，主张鲜卑族与汉族通婚，规定由鲜卑贵族带头，与汉族士族结亲。

……

这么多命令，出自于一个充分掌握了强权的少数民族统治者，而周围并没有人威逼他这么做，这确实太让人惊叹了。我认为，这不仅在中国，而且在世界历史上，也是极为罕见的。",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字论述了中国在实现大唐盛世之前，需要一股来自旷野的浩荡之气，秦汉帝国曾拥有过，但其后逐渐消散。鲜卑拓跋氏在征战后，建立了北魏王朝，并逐渐进行汉化改革，以适应和领导农耕文明。这些改革包括迁都、改变语言、服饰以及社会管理模式等，最终促进了中华文明的复兴。,1376

"聪明的牲口确乎知道人意，刚刚望见宅门，那马便立刻放缓脚步了，并且和它背上的主人同时垂了头，一步一顿，像捣米一样。

暮霭笼罩了大宅，邻屋上都腾起浓黑的炊烟，已经是晚饭时候。家将们听得马蹄声，早已迎了出来，都在宅门外垂着手直挺挺地站着。羿（2）在垃圾堆边懒懒地下了马，家将们便接过缰绳和鞭子去。他刚要跨进大门，低头看看挂在腰间的满壶的簇新的箭和网里的三匹乌老鸦和一匹射碎了的小麻雀，心里就非常踌蹰。但到底硬着头皮，大踏步走进去了；箭在壶里豁朗豁朗地响着。

刚到内院，他便见嫦娥（3）在圆窗里探了一探头。他知道她眼睛快，一定早瞧见那几匹乌鸦的了，不觉一吓，脚步登时也一停，——但只得往里走。使女们都迎出来，给他卸了弓箭，解下网兜。他仿佛觉得她们都在苦笑。

“太太……。”他擦过手脸，走进内房去，一面叫。

嫦娥正在看着圆窗外的暮天，慢慢回过头来，似理不理的向他看了一眼，没有答应。

这种情形，羿倒久已习惯的了，至少已有一年多。他仍旧走近去，坐在对面的铺着脱毛的旧豹皮的木榻上，搔着头皮，支支梧梧地说——

“今天的运气仍旧不见佳，还是只有乌鸦……。”

“哼！”嫦娥将柳眉一扬，忽然站起来，风似的往外走，嘴里咕噜着，“又是乌鸦的炸酱面，又是乌鸦的炸酱面！你去问问去，谁家是一年到头只吃乌鸦肉的炸酱面的？我真不知道是走了什么运，竟嫁到这里来，整年的就吃乌鸦的炸酱面！”

“太太，”羿赶紧也站起，跟在后面，低声说，“不过今天倒还好，另外还射了一匹麻雀，可以给你做菜的。女辛（4）！”他大声地叫使女，“你把那一匹麻雀拿过来请太太看！”

野味已经拿到厨房里去了，女辛便跑去挑出来，两手捧着，送在嫦娥的眼前。

“是的，”羿很惶恐，“射碎的。我的弓太强，箭头太大了。”

“你不能用小一点的箭头的么？”

“我没有小的。自从我射封豕长蛇（5）……。”",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字描述了羿在猎场归来后，因猎物不佳而与妻子嫦娥发生矛盾。羿家的家将迎接他回宅，他展示了自己的战利品——几匹乌鸦和一只碎成糟的麻雀，引起嫦娥的不满。嫦娥抱怨长期食用乌鸦肉感到厌倦和不满，甚至对羿的猎物质量提出了质疑，指出羿无法使用合适的箭头狩猎。,789
"聪明的牲口确乎知道人意，刚刚望见宅门，那马便立刻放缓脚步了，并且和它背上的主人同时垂了头，一步一顿，像捣米一样。

暮霭笼罩了大宅，邻屋上都腾起浓黑的炊烟，已经是晚饭时候。家将们听得马蹄声，早已迎了出来，都在宅门外垂着手直挺挺地站着。羿（2）在垃圾堆边懒懒地下了马，家将们便接过缰绳和鞭子去。他刚要跨进大门，低头看看挂在腰间的满壶的簇新的箭和网里的三匹乌老鸦和一匹射碎了的小麻雀，心里就非常踌蹰。但到底硬着头皮，大踏步走进去了；箭在壶里豁朗豁朗地响着。

刚到内院，他便见嫦娥（3）在圆窗里探了一探头。他知道她眼睛快，一定早瞧见那几匹乌鸦的了，不觉一吓，脚步登时也一停，——但只得往里走。使女们都迎出来，给他卸了弓箭，解下网兜。他仿佛觉得她们都在苦笑。

“太太……。”他擦过手脸，走进内房去，一面叫。

嫦娥正在看着圆窗外的暮天，慢慢回过头来，似理不理的向他看了一眼，没有答应。

这种情形，羿倒久已习惯的了，至少已有一年多。他仍旧走近去，坐在对面的铺着脱毛的旧豹皮的木榻上，搔着头皮，支支梧梧地说——

“今天的运气仍旧不见佳，还是只有乌鸦……。”

“哼！”嫦娥将柳眉一扬，忽然站起来，风似的往外走，嘴里咕噜着，“又是乌鸦的炸酱面，又是乌鸦的炸酱面！你去问问去，谁家是一年到头只吃乌鸦肉的炸酱面的？我真不知道是走了什么运，竟嫁到这里来，整年的就吃乌鸦的炸酱面！”

“太太，”羿赶紧也站起，跟在后面，低声说，“不过今天倒还好，另外还射了一匹麻雀，可以给你做菜的。女辛（4）！”他大声地叫使女，“你把那一匹麻雀拿过来请太太看！”

野味已经拿到厨房里去了，女辛便跑去挑出来，两手捧着，送在嫦娥的眼前。

"“瘫痪后你是怎么……譬如说，你是——？”记者一时不知怎么说好，双手像是比划着一个圆球。

我懂了他的意思，说：“那时我只想快点死。”

“哪里哪里，你太谦虚。”他微笑着，望着我。

可我那时是真想死，不记得怎么谦虚过。

“你是不是觉得不能再为人民……所以才……？”

我摇摇头，想起了我那时写过的一首诗：轻推小窗看春色，漏人人间一斜阳……

“那你为什么没有……？”记者象是有些失望了。

我说，我是命运的宠儿。他奇怪地瞪着我。

“您看我这手摇车，是十几个老同学凑钱给我买的……看这弹簧床，是个街坊给我做的……这棉裤，是邻居朱奶奶做的……还有这毛衣——那个女孩子也在我们街道生产组干过……生产组的门窄，手摇车进不去，一个小伙子天天背我……”

记者飞快地记着。“最好说件具体的。”他说。

我想了一会，找出了那张粮票（很破，中间贴了一条白纸）。

“前些年，您知道它对一个陕北的农民来说等于什么吗？”我说：“也许等于一辆汽车，也许等于一所别墅；当然，要看和谁比。不过，它比汽车和别墅可重要多了；为了舍不得这么张小纸片，有时会耽误了一条人命。”

记者看看那粮票，说：“是陕西省通用的？”

“是。可他不懂。我寄还给他，说这在北京不能用。他又给我寄了回来，说这是他卖了留着过年用的十斤好黄米才得来的，凭什么不能用？！噢，他是我插队时的房东老汉，喂牛的……”",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字描述了一位瘫痪的讲述者与记者之间的对话。记者询问讲述者瘫痪后的心境和生活状况，讲述者回忆起曾经有过轻生的念头，但受到朋友、邻居和街坊的帮助，坚持了下来。他提到一些具体的帮助细节，如老同学凑钱买的手摇车、街坊做的弹簧床、邻居朱奶奶做的棉裤等，并提到插队时的房东老汉寄粮票给他的故事，以此表现出人们之间朴素真挚的关怀和支持。,549

"有庆念了两年书，到了十岁光景，家里日子算是好过一些了，那时凤霞也跟看我们一起下地干活，凤霞已经能自己养活自己了。家里还养了两头羊，全靠有庆割草去喂它们。每天蒙蒙亮时，家珍就把有庆叫醒，这孩子把镰刀扔在篮子里，一只手提着，一只手搓着眼睛跌跌冲冲走出屋门去割草，那样子怪可怜的，孩子在这个年纪是最睡不醒的，可有什么办法呢？没有有庆去割草，两头羊就得饿死。到了有庆提着一篮草回来，上学也快迟到了，急忙往嘴里塞一碗饭，边嚼边往城里跑。中午跑回家又得割草，喂了羊再自己吃饭，上学自然又来不及了。有庆十来岁的时候，一天两次来去就得跑五十多里路。

有庆这么跑，鞋当然坏得快。家珍是城里有钱人家出生，觉得有庆是上学的孩子了，不能再光着脚丫，给他做了一双布鞋。我倒觉得上学只要把书念好就行，穿不穿鞋有什么关系。有庆穿上新鞋才两个月，我看到家珍又在纳鞋底，问她是给谁做鞋，她说是给有庆。

田里的活已经把家珍累得说话都没力气了，有庆非得把他娘累死。我把有庆穿了两个月的鞋拿起来一看，这哪还是鞋，鞋底磨穿了不说，一只鞋连鞋帮都掉了。等有庆提着满满一篮草回来时，我把鞋扔过去，揪住他的耳朵让他看看：

“你这是穿的，还是啃的？”

有庆摸着被揪疼的耳朵，咧了咧嘴，想哭又不敢哭。我警告他：

“你再这样穿鞋，我就把你的脚砍掉。”

其实是我没道理，家里的两头羊全靠有庆喂它们，这孩子在家干这么重的活，耽误了上学时间总是跑着去，中午放学想早点回来割草，又跑着回来。不说羊粪肥田这事，就是每年剪了羊毛去卖了的钱，也不知道能给有庆做多少双鞋。我这么一说以后，有庆上学就光脚丫跑去，到了学校再穿上鞋。

有一次都下雪了，他还是光着脚丫在雪地里吧哒吧哒往学校跑，让我这个做爹的看得好心疼，我叫住他：

“你手里拿着什么？”

这孩子站在雪地里看着手里的鞋，可能是糊涂了，都不知道说什么。我说：

“那是鞋，不是手套，你给我穿上。”

他这才穿上了鞋，缩着脑袋等我下面的话，我向他挥挥手：

“你走吧。”

有庆转身往城里跑，跑了没多远，我看到他又脱下了鞋。",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,这段文字描写了一位叫有庆的小男孩，他在十岁时每天需要割草喂养两头羊，还要去上学。因长期跑来跑去，他的鞋容易坏。有庆的母亲家珍不忍心孩子光脚，做了布鞋给他穿，但鞋子还是很快磨破。有庆的父亲曾因心疼鞋子揪过他的耳朵，但后来看到孩子冬天光脚跑着去学校，也感到心疼。这段描写反映了农村家庭的贫困和孩子承担的过重劳动。,863

许三观说：“你知道吗？为什么工厂停工了、商店关门了、学校不上课、你也用不着去炸抽条了？为什么有人被吊在了树上、有人被关进了牛棚、有人被活活打死？你知道吗？为什么毛主席一说话，就有人把他的话编成了歌，就有人把他的话刷到了墙上、刷到了地上、刷到了汽车上和轮船上、床单上和枕巾上、杯子上和锅上，连厕所的墙上和痰盂上都有。毛主席的名字为什么会这么长予你听着：伟大的领袖伟大的导师伟大的统帅伟大的舵手毛主席万岁万岁万万岁。一共有三十个字，这些都要一口气念下来，中间不能换气。你知道这是为什么？因为文化大革命来了

许三观说：”文化大革命闹到今天，我有点明白过来了，什么叫文化革命？其实就是一个报私分的时候，以前谁要是得罪了你，你就写一张大字报，贴到街上去，说他是漏网地主也好，说他是反革命也好，年月最多的就是罪名，随便拿一个过来，写到大字报上，再贴出去，就用不着你自己动手了，别人会把他在死里整……这些日子，我躺在床上左思右想，是不是找个仇人出亲，写他一张大字报，报一下旧仇。我想来想去，竟然想不出一个仇人来，只有何小勇能算半个仇人，可那个王八蛋何小勇四年前就让卡车给撞死了。我许三观为人善良，几十年如一日，没有一个仇人，这也好，我没有仇人，就不会有人来贴我的大字报。“

许三观话音未落，三乐推门进来，对他们说：”有人在米店墙上贴了一张大字报，说妈是破鞋

……“

许三观和许玉兰吓了一跳，立刻跑到米店那里，往墙上的大字报一看，三乐没有说错，在很多大字报里、有一张就是写许玉兰的，说许玉兰是破鞋，是烂货，说许玉兰十五岁就做了妓女，出两元钱就可以和她睡觉，说许玉兰睡过的男人十辆卡车都装不下。

许玉兰伸手指着那张大字报，破口大骂起来：”你妈才是破鞋，你妈才是烂货，你妈才是妓女，你妈睡过的男人，别说是十辆卡车，就是地球都装不下。“

然后，许玉兰转过身来，对着许三观哭了起来，她哭着说：”只有断子绝孙的人，只有头上长疮、脚底流脓的人，才会这么血口喷人……“

许三观对身旁的人说：”这全是诬每蔑，这上面说许玉兰十五岁就做了妓女！胡说！别人不知道，我还会不知道吗？我们结婚的那个晚上：，许玉兰流出来的血有这么多……“",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,中文,许三观描述了夏天他从街上回家时看到的文化大革命中的混乱景象，并向妻子许玉兰解释了文化大革命的背景和其社会影响。许三观提到有人利用大字报报私仇，但他认为自己没有仇人。然而，他的儿子三乐告诉他们，有人在米店墙上贴了一张关于许玉兰的诽谤大字报，内容侮辱性极强，指责她曾经是妓女。许玉兰对此非常愤怒并大声斥责，而许三观则向身旁人证明这些指控是诬蔑，因为他知道事实真相。,1107
"山西人真能吃醋！几个山西人在北京下饭馆，坐定之后，还没有点菜，先把醋瓶子拿过来，每人喝了三调羹醋。邻座的客人直瞪眼。有一年我到太原去，快过春节了。别处过春节，都供应一点好酒，太原的油盐店却都贴出一个条子：“供应老陈醋，每户一斤。”这在山西人是大事。

山西人还爱吃酸菜，雁北尤甚。什么都拿来酸，除了萝卜白菜，还包括杨树叶子，榆树钱儿。有人来给姑娘说亲，当妈的先问，那家有几口酸菜缸。酸菜缸多，说明家底子厚。

四川夹沙肉用大片肥猪肉夹了洗沙蒸，广西芋头扣肉用大片肥猪肉夹芋泥蒸，都极甜，很好吃，但我最多只能吃两片。

广东人爱吃甜食。昆明金碧路有一家广东人开的甜品店，卖芝麻糊、绿豆沙，广东同学趋之若鹜。“番薯糖水”即用白薯切块熬的汤，这有什么好喝的呢？广东同学曰：“好！”

北方人不是不爱吃甜，只是过去糖难得。我家曾有老保姆，正定乡下人，六十多岁了。她还有个婆婆，八十几了。她有一次要回乡探亲，临行称了两斤白糖，说她的婆婆就爱喝个白糖水。

"Even as the two creatures leaped down to the floor, and before they could change their low cries of astonishment into louder cries of alarm, Marlin and I had leaped across the compartment toward them! For a full two-score feet in one great leap we shot toward them, a feat only possible with Triton's lesser gravitation, and only possible, too, because we knew in that moment that a single loud cry from the two creatures would bring to their aid the hundreds of Neptunians sleeping about us. Before either could utter such a cry, we two had shot through the air and were upon them!
So astounded were they with our appearance and our supernatural leap across the compartment, that before they could put themselves into a posture of defense, we had struck them, had knocked them to the floor and were grappling with them. In that first moment of contact I had reached for the mouth-opening of the disk-bodied monster at whom I had leaped, had gripped that opening in the top of its disk-body to prevent its outcry and then had striven to lift the thing sidewise, to hurl it against the floor. But great as was my strength against Triton's lesser gravitation, the strength of the Neptunian I held was greater still, and its weight, due to the weight-disks worn by it, was enormous. In an instant its seven great limbs were clutching for me, grasping me, and as I strained there against that great monstrous disk-body's grip, I knew with fatal certainty that never could I match my strength against its own. For even as I struggled desperately with it, Marlin struggling as wildly with the other beside me, the thing was lifting me with its own great limbs from the floor!
Upward it drew me with those powerful limbs, its bulging glassy eyes staring from its disk-body's edge straight into my own, as we grappled desperately in the dark compartment with the sleeping Neptunians all about us! I felt myself being overcome, my strength puny beside the strength of that monster, and as I clutched wildly still at the mouth-opening in the top of the disk-body, I thrust my clenched fist down into that small round mouth-opening, half by chance and half by design, closing it thus with my balled fist. Instantly the creature's body turned and twisted frantically, its grip upon me forgotten for the moment, its whole body's mass seeming to heave and twitch as my hand thus cut off the passage of air into that mouth-opening, into its body! I was throttling it, I knew, and hung fiercely to my grip upon it, my clenched hand still within its mouth-opening, while the thing swayed and tore at me with ever-decreasing strength. A moment more and its struggles ceased, it collapsed limply to the floor, and I staggered up again to my feet.
In a single glance I saw that the other Neptunian had gripped Marlin and was crushing him against a corner of the compartment's shelving and instantly, with a single great leap, I was upon that other monster, had gained upon it the same throttling grip which I had found was so deadly to these creatures. In a flash the Neptunian had released his hold upon Marlin, was whirling me around the compartment, shaking me this way and that, and wildly attempting to tear itself loose from me, but with the last of my strength I hung to it, and in a few moments it, too, had weakened, then had slumped down in a lifeless, grotesque mass. And as I rose from it I saw that Marlin had staggered up likewise, was coming toward me. None other of the Neptunians had been aroused by the noise of our mad combat, because in the first excitement of that combat the two Neptunians we fought had not thought to cry out, and after I had gained that throttling hold upon them they could not. So around us the silent ranks of Neptunians slept on unaroused, their open, glassy eyes full upon us even in their sleep, while Marlin and I were stumbling toward the compartment's door.
""On, Hunt!"" he whispered hoarsely. ""We still have a chance, if we can find a landing-compartment, can steal one of the cylinders before these sleeping Neptunians wake!""
Through the next compartment we went, and the next, and the next, all sleep-compartments, filled with rows of slumbering Neptunians like those behind us, but in our progress we had come upon no landing-compartment. And though we knew that such there were here and there on Triton's dark side, we could not tell, in the darkness and with the huge walls towering all around us, in what direction from us they might be. We could but blunder aimlessly on through the maze of adjoining sleep-compartments in the blind hope that we might chance upon one of the landing-sections, and as we went on, staggering in great, irregular leaps through compartment after compartment, all filled either with masses of sleeping Neptunians or with great heat-radiating mechanisms, we knew that at any moment might come the great signal of light that would awaken the hordes around us.
Never could there have been flight more nightmare-like than that of Marlin and myself through the dark compartments of Triton's dark side, in blind search for the cylinders which alone held out to us any chance of escape. Through the sleep-compartments, with their masses of open-eyed and sleeping disk-bodied Neptunians, through the compartments where reared the great glowing globes whose radiated heat alone held back the cold doom that so long had threatened these strange beings, through compartment after compartment in a flight made more grotesque and unreal to us by the strange method of our progress; by the strange, great, smooth leaps that we made instead of steps, great floating leaps of a score of feet in which we rushed through the dark sleeping compartments, reckless now of the few Neptunians who might be waking and moving upon the dark side. Then suddenly as we leaped toward the door of still another sleep-compartment, poised an instant to leap through that low door, we halted, gazed with abruptly-flaring hope ahead. For the next compartment, we saw, was a rectangular one and greater in size than any we had passed through as yet, and in it there stood the great gleaming shapes of a score or more of the cylinder-fliers that we sought!
With hearts pounding Marlin and I crouched in the low door, gazing through the darkness toward those great cylinders, that gleamed a little in the feeble light that came down upon Triton's dark side from the stars through the great roof overhead. We saw that the low doors in the sides of those cylinders, near the bases, were open, and from them there came to us the throbbing of their mechanisms, inside! It was evident that these were part of the countless cylinders used to help in transporting the Neptunian hordes from dark side to sunward side of Triton, and vice versa, and it was equally evident from those throbbing mechanisms' operation, that the hour of awakening for those hordes was at hand and that these were waiting for that awakening. For there stood also, between us and the nearest of the cylinders, three tube-armed Neptunians who were conversing in brief, snapping speech as they waited!",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"Marlin and Hunt find themselves in a desperate situation on Triton as they encounter Neptunian creatures. Relying on the reduced gravity to perform incredible leaps, they attack and grapple with the creatures to prevent them from alerting the sleeping horde.

After defeating both Neptunians, they continue their escape mission through a maze of sleep compartments filled with slumbering Neptunians. They aim to find landing compartments with cylinder-fliers to escape. Their escape is complicated by the dark, the looming risk of awakening the hordes, and their unusual mode of movement. Eventually, their hope surges as they spot a larger compartment containing the sought-after cylinder-fliers.

I was throttling it, I knew, and hung fiercely to my grip upon it, my clenched hand still within its mouth-opening, while the thing swayed and tore at me with ever-decreasing strength. A moment more and its struggles ceased, it collapsed limply to the floor, and I staggered up again to my feet.
In a single glance I saw that the other Neptunian had gripped Marlin and was crushing him against a corner of the compartment's shelving and instantly, with a single great leap, I was upon that other monster, had gained upon it the same throttling grip which I had found was so deadly to these creatures. In a flash the Neptunian had released his hold upon Marlin, was whirling me around the compartment, shaking me this way and that, and wildly attempting to tear itself loose from me, but with the last of my strength I hung to it, and in a few moments it, too, had weakened, then had slumped down in a lifeless, grotesque mass. And as I rose from it I saw that Marlin had staggered up likewise, was coming toward me. None other of the Neptunians had been aroused by the noise of our mad combat, because in the first excitement of that combat the two Neptunians we fought had not thought to cry out, and after I had gained that throttling hold upon them they could not. So around us the silent ranks of Neptunians slept on unaroused, their open, glassy eyes full upon us even in their sleep, while Marlin and I were stumbling toward the compartment's door.
""On, Hunt!"" he whispered hoarsely. ""We still have a chance, if we can find a landing-compartment, can steal one of the cylinders before these sleeping Neptunians wake!""
Through the next compartment we went, and the next, and the next, all sleep-compartments, filled with rows of slumbering Neptunians like those behind us, but in our progress we had come upon no landing-compartment. And though we knew that such there were here and there on Triton's dark side, we could not tell, in the darkness and with the huge walls towering all around us, in what direction from us they might be. We could but blunder aimlessly on through the maze of adjoining sleep-compartments in the blind hope that we might chance upon one of the landing-sections, and as we went on, staggering in great, irregular leaps through compartment after compartment, all filled either with masses of sleeping Neptunians or with great heat-radiating mechanisms, we knew that at any moment might come the great signal of light that would awaken the hordes around us.
Never could there have been flight more nightmare-like than that of Marlin and myself through the dark compartments of Triton's dark side, in blind search for the cylinders which alone held out to us any chance of escape. Through the sleep-compartments, with their masses of open-eyed and sleeping disk-bodied Neptunians, through the compartments where reared the great glowing globes whose radiated heat alone held back the cold doom that so long had threatened these strange beings, through compartment after compartment in a flight made more grotesque and unreal to us by the strange method of our progress; by the strange, great, smooth leaps that we made instead of steps, great floating leaps of a score of feet in which we rushed through the dark sleeping compartments, reckless now of the few Neptunians who might be waking and moving upon the dark side. Then suddenly as we leaped toward the door of still another sleep-compartment, poised an instant to leap through that low door, we halted, gazed with abruptly-flaring hope ahead. For the next compartment, we saw, was a rectangular one and greater in size than any we had passed through as yet, and in it there stood the great gleaming shapes of a score or more of the cylinder-fliers that we sought!
With hearts pounding Marlin and I crouched in the low door, gazing through the darkness toward those great cylinders, that gleamed a little in the feeble light that came down upon Triton's dark side from the stars through the great roof overhead. We saw that the low doors in the sides of those cylinders, near the bases, were open, and from them there came to us the throbbing of their mechanisms, inside! It was evident that these were part of the countless cylinders used to help in transporting the Neptunian hordes from dark side to sunward side of Triton, and vice versa, and it was equally evident from those throbbing mechanisms' operation, that the hour of awakening for those hordes was at hand and that these were waiting for that awakening. For there stood also, between us and the nearest of the cylinders, three tube-armed Neptunians who were conversing in brief, snapping speech as they waited!",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"Marlin and Hunt find themselves in a desperate situation on Triton as they encounter Neptunian creatures. Relying on the reduced gravity to perform incredible leaps, they attack and grapple with the creatures to prevent them from alerting the sleeping horde. Hunt manages to choke one Neptunian by blocking its mouth opening, while Marlin struggles against another. After defeating both Neptunians, they continue their escape mission through a maze of sleep compartments filled with slumbering Neptunians. They aim to find landing compartments with cylinder-fliers to escape. Their escape is complicated by the dark, the looming risk of awakening the hordes, and their unusual mode of movement. Eventually, their hope surges as they spot a larger compartment containing the sought-after cylinder-fliers. Observing three Neptunians near the cylinders conversing, they realize the urgency as the mechanisms signify the impending awakening of the horde.",1233
"Colletta, in speaking of the Carbonari, considers this sect to be derived from the Freemasons of Germany—transported into their country by the Neapolitan exiles of 1799, on their return.

"All this was pleasing to us, as confirming that we had learned from Vincaly Row, and when we were safely lodged that night in the rest-house of the village, and had supped well, though not extravagantly, my friend and I discoursed much of the means whereby we might soonest place ourselves in security. For it seemed, by what the Brachmine had told us, that to reach the Moratty army by the shortest way we must needs pass through a rugged country, extreme difficult to traverse with such a train as ours, while the other way, where there was a good road enough, should occupy us still two or three days. And moreover, between us and Seva Gi there lay the strong fortress of Tashpour, whence, as we had no doubt, Cogia Bux would be looking forth for us, and our train being so large, it was little like that we should be able to slip past him. These difficulties that threatened us we discussed with great freedom, at one time even purposing to abandon all our stuff (which, though valuable, was little in comparison with life), and take the short road with only our men. But telling this to Loll Duss, who was making ready where we should lie that night, he showed himself prodigiously concerned, and entreated with much respect that we would allow him to make a certain proposition to us. Which we permitting, he begged of us to leave our train in his care, both the men and all the beasts, that he might conduct it to the camp of Seva Gi by the longer road, while we, the viscount and I, rid on without encumbrance by the short way. It went to his heart (said the honest fellow) that we should be left without the attendance suited to our quality, but by submitting to this trifling inconvenience we should be secure of regaining in the space of a few days all our goods, in the stead of being compelled to undertake the rest of our journey without ’em. And this plan of his seeming to us very good and well-considered, we gave to’t our attention, and went to bed resolved upon adopting it.
And setting out in the morning as usual, lest the villagers should perceive our divided forces, we separated from one another at some distance from the place where we had slept, our servants and cooleys taking the road to the left hand, and my friend and I that to the right. Meanwhile, I was not a little exercised in my mind as to whether we were doing the best we might, and did give Loll Duss many commands touching what he should do in respect to certain dangers, as that in case of any pursuit made of them, they must all leave their packs and escape into the woods, not rashly perilling their lives for such poor silly stuff as beds and kettles. In all this he heard me very patiently, though I am well assured he would never have suffered any such thing to be done, and so we separated from them, my friend and I riding on in the sweet morning air, the which was mighty soft and agreeable, with as little concern as if that were not to be the most weighty day of both of our lives, or at least of mine.
Through all the morning we held on at a good pace, our horses being sound and swift, and at noon or thereabouts halted for a rest of two hours, for more we dared not take, if we were to reach Seva Gi and his army by sunset. Setting out again on our journey after this time of repose, we found that we must needs progress with great circumspection, since we now beheld very clearly the great citadel of Tashpour frowning from its lofty steep before us. And here the viscount showed very evidently the value of that training he had received, for his eye told him of every ridge and every grove that might afford us concealment in our riding, and we were well abreast of the fortress before we were forced to relinquish our cover. But here that which we had hailed as our salvation became, so to speak, a destruction unto us, for we had been riding in the shadow of the edge of a certain great wood, so that even had any been watching for us from the castle they had scarce been able to perceive us against the dark trees, and now we come full upon a huge quag or morass, wherein my horse had like to have sunk before I could turn him and get him out. And looking to see where this quag might end, we found that it spread into the wood for some distance (making a dark and loathsome mire and mud, very hideous to behold), nay, we could not reach with our eyes the furthest limits on’t, so that our sole plan was to ride out upon the plain and fetch a compass about it. And this, because time pressed, and we might not search in the wood, to seek the other end on’t, we did set about immediately, though doing our best to ride leisurely, so as any perceiving us might take us only for honest countrymen bent on their occasions. But when we come out upon the plain, our beasts and we were evidently visible against the clear green colour of the rushes by the side of the quag, and before we could even circle round the end on’t, the viscount bid me look round, and I obeying saw a troop of horse coming out of a gate of the castle in pursuit of us.
Now these men were so close after us that they arrived at the side of the quag nearest to the fortress when we were still riding along the further margent thereof with all possible haste for to regain our road, so that they did let fly at us with their matchlocks, as hoping thereby to cripple and so delay us. But by God’s great mercy they hit neither my friend nor me, their bullets all falling short of us, save one only, which did strike my friend’s horse, making it halt and stagger for a moment. But he calling out to it cheerfully, for he was used always to speak to his beast as though it were indeed a rational creature that could understand him, it went on again bravely, and we two rid away at our utmost speed along our road.",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"The passage narrates the journey of two friends who, on advice from Vincaly Row, aim to reach the Moratty army. They face two route options: a treacherous short route and a safer but longer route. Fearful of being detected by Cogia Bux at the Tashpour fortress, they consider abandoning their valuable train. Loll Duss suggests taking the train safely via the longer route and allowing the two friends to take the short route unencumbered. Agreeing to the plan, they set off separately, with the friends progressing cautiously past the Tashpour fortress. Despite their best efforts, they encounter an unexpected quagmire and are seen by guards from the fortress. Pursued by horsemen, they narrowly escape being shot, although one bullet injures the friend's horse. With perseverance and skill, they manage to evade their pursuers, continuing their journey towards the Moratty army.",1101

But telling this to Loll Duss, who was making ready where we should lie that night, he showed himself prodigiously concerned, and entreated with much respect that we would allow him to make a certain proposition to us. Which we permitting, he begged of us to leave our train in his care, both the men and all the beasts, that he might conduct it to the camp of Seva Gi by the longer road, while we, the viscount and I, rid on without encumbrance by the short way. It went to his heart (said the honest fellow) that we should be left without the attendance suited to our quality, but by submitting to this trifling inconvenience we should be secure of regaining in the space of a few days all our goods, in the stead of being compelled to undertake the rest of our journey without ’em. And this plan of his seeming to us very good and well-considered, we gave to’t our attention, and went to bed resolved upon adopting it.
And setting out in the morning as usual, lest the villagers should perceive our divided forces, we separated from one another at some distance from the place where we had slept, our servants and cooleys taking the road to the left hand, and my friend and I that to the right. Meanwhile, I was not a little exercised in my mind as to whether we were doing the best we might, and did give Loll Duss many commands touching what he should do in respect to certain dangers, as that in case of any pursuit made of them, they must all leave their packs and escape into the woods, not rashly perilling their lives for such poor silly stuff as beds and kettles. In all this he heard me very patiently, though I am well assured he would never have suffered any such thing to be done, and so we separated from them, my friend and I riding on in the sweet morning air, the which was mighty soft and agreeable, with as little concern as if that were not to be the most weighty day of both of our lives, or at least of mine.
Through all the morning we held on at a good pace, our horses being sound and swift, and at noon or thereabouts halted for a rest of two hours, for more we dared not take, if we were to reach Seva Gi and his army by sunset. Setting out again on our journey after this time of repose, we found that we must needs progress with great circumspection, since we now beheld very clearly the great citadel of Tashpour frowning from its lofty steep before us. And here the viscount showed very evidently the value of that training he had received, for his eye told him of every ridge and every grove that might afford us concealment in our riding, and we were well abreast of the fortress before we were forced to relinquish our cover. But here that which we had hailed as our salvation became, so to speak, a destruction unto us, for we had been riding in the shadow of the edge of a certain great wood, so that even had any been watching for us from the castle they had scarce been able to perceive us against the dark trees, and now we come full upon a huge quag or morass, wherein my horse had like to have sunk before I could turn him and get him out. And looking to see where this quag might end, we found that it spread into the wood for some distance (making a dark and loathsome mire and mud, very hideous to behold), nay, we could not reach with our eyes the furthest limits on’t, so that our sole plan was to ride out upon the plain and fetch a compass about it. And this, because time pressed, and we might not search in the wood, to seek the other end on’t, we did set about immediately, though doing our best to ride leisurely, so as any perceiving us might take us only for honest countrymen bent on their occasions. But when we come out upon the plain, our beasts and we were evidently visible against the clear green colour of the rushes by the side of the quag, and before we could even circle round the end on’t, the viscount bid me look round, and I obeying saw a troop of horse coming out of a gate of the castle in pursuit of us.
Now these men were so close after us that they arrived at the side of the quag nearest to the fortress when we were still riding along the further margent thereof with all possible haste for to regain our road, so that they did let fly at us with their matchlocks, as hoping thereby to cripple and so delay us. But by God’s great mercy they hit neither my friend nor me, their bullets all falling short of us, save one only, which did strike my friend’s horse, making it halt and stagger for a moment. But he calling out to it cheerfully, for he was used always to speak to his beast as though it were indeed a rational creature that could understand him, it went on again bravely, and we two rid away at our utmost speed along our road.",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"The passage narrates the journey of two friends who, on advice from Vincaly Row, aim to reach the Moratty army.

"All this was pleasing to us, as confirming that we had learned from Vincaly Row, and when we were safely lodged that night in the rest-house of the village, and had supped well, though not extravagantly, my friend and I discoursed much of the means whereby we might soonest place ourselves in security. For it seemed, by what the Brachmine had told us, that to reach the Moratty army by the shortest way we must needs pass through a rugged country, extreme difficult to traverse with such a train as ours, while the other way, where there was a good road enough, should occupy us still two or three days.

"""Yes sir,"" he said, ""efficiency ... regulation ... order ... that's what's spoiling all life these days. Those addle-headed scientists aren't satisfied unless they can dovetail everything.""
Raine smiled and in the pause that followed cast his eyes about the room. It was circular and no attempt had been made to conceal its origin: the bridge-house of some discarded space-going tug. Along the continuous wall ran a triple tier of bookshelves, but it seemed that most of the books lay scattered on the table, chairs, and floor.
Above the shelves the wall was decorated with several three-dimensional water colors, pin-up girls in various stages of undress and mounted trophies of the rather hideous game Straba provided.
""About this survey,"" the kid began.
""Only last month,"" Cap Barlow continued, unmindful of the interruption, ""a salesman stopped off here and wanted to sell me a gadget for my golf course. Said it would increase the gravitation over the fairways and prevent the ball from traveling any farther than it does on Earth.""
He spat disgustedly. ""You'd think any fool would realize it's an ideal course that can offer a Par three on a thousand yard hole.""
But Raine hadn't come this far to listen to the dissertations of an old man. He was tired from long hours of sitting at the console of his ship. He stood up wearily.
""If you'll show me where I can stow my gear,"" he said, ""I think I'll turn in and get some sleep. I've got a lot to do tomorrow.""
For a week the kid didn't bother Cap at all. Each morning he went out with a reference book, a haversack and a canteen, and he didn't show up again until dark. Cap didn't mention that Straba had been officially surveyed ten years before or that results of this survey had been practically negative as far as adding to the Interplanetary Pharmacopoeia went. If Tri-Planet wanted to train its green personnel by sending them on a wild goose chase, that was all right with Cap.
But the old man had one thing that interested young Raine: his telescope mounted in a domed observatory on the top floor. Every night, Raine spent hours staring through that scope, sighting stars, marking them on the charts. Cap tried to tell him that those charts were as perfect as human intellect could make them. Raine had an answer for that too.
""Those charts are three years old,"" he said. ""In three years a whole universe could be created or destroyed. Take a look at this star on Graph 5. I've been watching it, and the way it's acting convinces me there's another star, probably a Wanderer, approaching it from here."" He indicated a spot on the chart.
He was efficient and persistent. He watched his star, checked and rechecked his calculation, and in the end, to Cap's amazement sighted the Wanderer almost exactly where he said it would be.
That discovery only excited him more and after that he spent an even greater amount of time in the observatory. Then late one night he came to the top of the stairs and called for Cap.
Cap went up to the scope, and at first he didn't see anything. Then he did see it: a darker shadow against the interrupted starlight.
""It's a ship,"" the old man said.
Raine nodded. ""My guess too. But what's it doing out of regular space lanes?""
""You forget you landed here yourself. Straba does occasionally attract a visitor. Her crew may need water or food.""
Raine shook his head. ""I hedge-hopped in from asteroid, Torela. This fellow seems to be coming from deep space.""
They continued to watch that approaching shadow, taking turns at looking through the scope. It seemed to take a long time coming; but finally there was a roar and a rush of air and a black shape hurtled out of the eastern sky. The two men ran outside where Cap began to curse volubly. The ship's anti-gravs were only partially on. It had hit hard, digging up three hundred yards of the sixteenth fairway and completely ruined two greens.
Then the dust cleared and the two men stared. The ship was a derelict, a piece of space flotsam. There was no question about that. It was also a Cyblla-style coach, one of the first Earth-made passenger freighters to utilize a power-pile drive, designed when streamlining was thought to mean following the shape of a cigar. On her bow was a name but meteorite shrapnel had partially obliterated the letters.
""Jingoes,"" said Raine, ""I never saw a ship like this before. She must be old—really old!""
The hatches were badly fused and oxidized, and it was evident that without a blaster it would be impossible to get in. Cap shrugged.
""Let her stay there,"" he said. ""I can make a dog-leg out of the fifteenth, and keep the course fairly playable. And if I get tired of seeing that big hulk out of my dining room window I can always plant some python vines around the nearside of her.""
Raine shook his head quickly. ""There's no telling what we may find inside. We've got to find an opening.""
He went over the ship like a squirrel looking for a nut. Back under her stern quarter, just abaft her implosion plates, he found a small refuse scuttle which seemed movable. He took drills and went to work on it.
Three hours later the two men were inside. There was nothing unusual about the crew quarters or the adjoining storage space. But when they reached the control cabin they stood and gaped.
It was like entering a museum. The bulkheads were covered with queer glass dials, and several panels of manual operating switches. The power-pile conduits were shielded with lead—lead mind you—and the lighting was apparently done with some kind of fluorescent tubes bracketed to the ceiling. It brought Cap back to the time he was a kid and his grandfather told him stories and legends of the past.

"Sar stared at him in awe, as one would stare at an unbelievable monstrosity, born in a fertilely imaginative mind and portrayed in the TDs by an actor suitably deformed by the genius of make-up. But this was no TD image—this monster was real and he was standing only a few feet away, leering at her, challenging her, hurting her, condemning her.
They knew that she could bring forth no witnesses in her defense. That was what made the challenge so cruel. They knew that she had had no lovers since before her first child was born, nineteen years ago. She had been a virtuous wife, a faithful wife. And now they were turning her very virtue against her!
""Do you have such a witness?"" Justice Klyutch asked her attorney.
""I ask the court's permission to confer privately with my client,"" the lawyer replied, rising hastily from his seat.
""Granted.""
""No,"" Sar said abruptly. Her lawyer had hardly started across the room to the witness seat when her voice stopped him. ""No,"" Sar repeated, ""we have no witness.""
""Your Honors,"" her lawyer said hurriedly, ""I request that my client's remark be stricken from the record. It was not made in reply to a question, nor was it on advice of counsel."" To Sar he said, ""Please, Mrs. Wisson, do not volunteer information before you consult me.""
""Why not?"" Sar asked sadly. ""There is no one. What good would it do to consult you?""
""Please, Mrs. Wisson,"" the lawyer insisted. ""Perhaps there is someone whom you've forgotten. Perhaps you'll remember if you discuss it with me. Perhaps....""
""No,"" Sar pronounced, finally. ""There has been no one. I won't invent a mythical lover. We have no witness.""
The lawyer returned to his seat dejectedly. Sar had ruined whatever chance he might have had to bring in a false witness to dispute those presented by her husband.
If the court accepted the testimony of the four supposed lovers, the case was lost. Even without their testimony, it was a toss-up between Sar's word and her husband's. After all, records of an ability possessed twenty years ago really proved nothing about the present. So what if she had been an exceptionally apt student in school? After twenty years, she might be different—altogether different. She might very well be incompetent.
Sar, too, knew that she had spoiled her own opportunity to counteract the fraudulent testimony of her husband's friends. Yet, although she was afraid of the consequences of losing the case, she could not bring herself to lie about her private life. She could not claim lovers she had not had. It was ridiculous, she knew, in this day and age, but she was actually proud of her fidelity.
She watched the three judges lean together in conference. The million eyes still peered at her. They pawed at her body, probed at her thoughts. She fidgeted under their merciless scrutiny as the minutes crept by and the judges' conference continued.

"Sar stared at him in awe, as one would stare at an unbelievable monstrosity, born in a fertilely imaginative mind and portrayed in the TDs by an actor suitably deformed by the genius of make-up.

They knew that she could bring forth no witnesses in her defense. That was what made the challenge so cruel. They knew that she had had no lovers since before her first child was born, nineteen years ago. She had been a virtuous wife, a faithful wife. And now they were turning her very virtue against her!
""Do you have such a witness?"" Justice Klyutch asked her attorney.
""I ask the court's permission to confer privately with my client,"" the lawyer replied, rising hastily from his seat.
""Granted.""
""No,"" Sar said abruptly. Her lawyer had hardly started across the room to the witness seat when her voice stopped him. ""No,"" Sar repeated, ""we have no witness.""

""Please, Mrs. Wisson,"" the lawyer insisted. ""Perhaps there is someone whom you've forgotten. Perhaps you'll remember if you discuss it with me. Perhaps....""
""No,"" Sar pronounced, finally. ""There has been no one. I won't invent a mythical lover. We have no witness.""
The lawyer returned to his seat dejectedly. Sar had ruined whatever chance he might have had to bring in a false witness to dispute those presented by her husband.
If the court accepted the testimony of the four supposed lovers, the case was lost. Even without their testimony, it was a toss-up between Sar's word and her husband's. After all, records of an ability possessed twenty years ago really proved nothing about the present. So what if she had been an exceptionally apt student in school? After twenty years, she might be different—altogether different. She might very well be incompetent.
Sar, too, knew that she had spoiled her own opportunity to counteract the fraudulent testimony of her husband's friends. Yet, although she was afraid of the consequences of losing the case, she could not bring herself to lie about her private life. She could not claim lovers she had not had. It was ridiculous, she knew, in this day and age, but she was actually proud of her fidelity.
She watched the three judges lean together in conference. The million eyes still peered at her. They pawed at her body, probed at her thoughts. She fidgeted under their merciless scrutiny as the minutes crept by and the judges' conference continued.

"As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal, and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft, unless they previously produced their papers.
“What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?” said I, now jumping on the bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.
“I mean,” he replied, “he must show his papers.”
“Yes,” said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from behind Peleg’s, out of the wigwam. “He must show that he’s converted. Son of darkness,” he added, turning to Queequeg, “art thou at present in communion with any Christian church?”
“Why,” said I, “he’s a member of the first Congregational Church.” Here be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches.
“First Congregational Church,” cried Bildad, “what! that worships in Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman’s meeting-house?” and so saying, taking out his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at Queequeg.
“How long hath he been a member?” he then said, turning to me; “not very long, I rather guess, young man.”
“No,” said Peleg, “and he hasn’t been baptized right either, or it would have washed some of that devil’s blue off his face.”
“Do tell, now,” cried Bildad, “is this Philistine a regular member of Deacon Deuteronomy’s meeting? I never saw him going there, and I pass it every Lord’s day.”
“I don’t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting,” said I; “all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First Congregational Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.”
“Young man,” said Bildad sternly, “thou art skylarking with me—explain thyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean? answer me.”
Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. “I mean, sir, the same ancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there, and Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother’s son and soul of us belong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in that we all join hands.”
“Splice, thou mean’st splice hands,” cried Peleg, drawing nearer. “Young man, you’d better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast hand; I never heard a better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy—why Father Mapple himself couldn’t beat it, and he’s reckoned something. Come aboard, come aboard; never mind about the papers. I say, tell Quohog there—what’s that you call him? tell Quohog to step along. By the great anchor, what a harpoon he’s got there! looks like good stuff that; and he handles it about right. I say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did you ever stand in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a fish?”
Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon the bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats hanging to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his harpoon, cried out in some such way as this:—
“Cap’ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You see him? well, spose him one whale eye, well, den!” and taking sharp aim at it, he darted the iron right over old Bildad’s broad brim, clean across the ship’s decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.
“Now,” said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, “spos-ee him whale-e eye; why, dad whale dead.”
“Quick, Bildad,” said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin gangway. “Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship’s papers. We must have Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye, Quohog, we’ll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that’s more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.”
So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon enrolled among the same ship’s company to which I myself belonged.
When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for signing, he turned to me and said, “I guess, Quohog there don’t know how to write, does he? I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark?”
But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the offered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm; so that through Captain Peleg’s obstinate mistake touching his appellative, it stood something like this:—
Quohog. his X mark.
Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg, and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one entitled “The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose,” placed it in Queequeg’s hands, and then grasping them and the book with both his, looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, “Son of darkness, I must do my duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways, which I sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial bondsman. Spurn the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the wrath to come; mind thine eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer clear of the fiery pit!”
Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad’s language, heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.
“Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our harpooneer,” cried Peleg. “Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers—it takes the shark out of ’em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish. There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the meeting, and never came to good. He got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he shrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear of after-claps, in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones.”
“Peleg! Peleg!” said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, “thou thyself, as I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest, Peleg, what it is to have the fear of death; how, then, can’st thou prate in this ungodly guise. Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on Japan, that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab, did’st thou not think of Death and the Judgment then?”
“Hear him, hear him now,” cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,—“hear him, all of ye. Think of that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink! Death and the Judgment then? What? With all three masts making such an everlasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over us, fore and aft. Think of Death and the Judgment then? No! no time to think about Death then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of; and how to save all hands—how to rig jury-masts—how to get into the nearest port; that was what I was thinking of.”
Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck, where we followed him. There he stood, very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist.

Spurn the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the wrath to come; mind thine eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer clear of the fiery pit!”
Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad’s language, heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.
“Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our harpooneer,” cried Peleg. “Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers—it takes the shark out of ’em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish. There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the meeting, and never came to good. He got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he shrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear of after-claps, in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones.”
“Peleg! Peleg!” said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, “thou thyself, as I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest, Peleg, what it is to have the fear of death; how, then, can’st thou prate in this ungodly guise. Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on Japan, that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab, did’st thou not think of Death and the Judgment then?”
“Hear him, hear him now,” cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,—“hear him, all of ye. Think of that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink! Death and the Judgment then? What? With all three masts making such an everlasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over us, fore and aft. Think of Death and the Judgment then? No! no time to think about Death then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of; and how to save all hands—how to rig jury-masts—how to get into the nearest port; that was what I was thinking of.”
Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck, where we followed him. There he stood, very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist. Now and then he stooped to pick up a patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which otherwise might have been wasted.",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"In this passage, the narrator and Queequeg, carrying his harpoon, are intercepted by Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad as they approach a ship. Captain Peleg, upon realizing Queequeg is a 'cannibal,' insists he must show conversion papers to Christianity before boarding. The narrator cleverly asserts that Queequeg is a member of the universal 'First Congregational Church,' which leads to Queequeg demonstrating his harpooning skill to prove his worth. Impressed, Captains Peleg and Bildad decide to hire Queequeg without further concern for his religion. Queequeg signs the ship’s papers with a tattooed mark. Captain Bildad, worried for Queequeg’s soul, implores him to abandon his pagan ways. The discussion veers into a debate between Peleg and Bildad about the role of religious fear during perilous voyages, citing past experiences. The passage concludes with Bildad retreating to oversee sail repairs on deck.",1344
"LIZABETH’S impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.
Miss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given him.
“His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment.{279}”
“Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”
“Blame you! Oh, no.”
“But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”
“No—I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”
“But you will know it, when I have told you what happened the very next day.”
She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane, who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual! Nor was Darcy’s vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other.
“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr. Darcy’s, but you shall do as you choose.”
It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.
“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief.{280} And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing, I am sure you must feel it so.”
“Oh no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.”
“Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner.”
“There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it.”
“I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do.”
“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one’s genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”
“Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now.”
“Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I was very uncomfortable—I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to of what I felt, no Jane to comfort me, and say that I had not been so very weak, and{281} vain, and nonsensical, as I knew I had! Oh, how I wanted you!”
“How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they do appear wholly undeserved.”
“Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham’s character.”
Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.

"Well, I warn’t long making him understand I warn’t dead. I was ever so glad to see Jim. I warn’t lonesome now. I told him I warn’t afraid of him telling the people where I was. I talked along, but he only set there and looked at me; never said nothing. Then I says:
“It’s good daylight. Le’s get breakfast. Make up your camp fire good.”
“What’s de use er makin’ up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich truck? But you got a gun, hain’t you? Den we kin git sumfn better den strawbries.”
“Strawberries and such truck,” I says. “Is that what you live on?”
“I couldn’ git nuffn else,” he says.
“Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?”
“I come heah de night arter you’s killed.”
“What, all that time?”
“Yes—indeedy.”
“And ain’t you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?”
“No, sah—nuffn else.”
“Well, you must be most starved, ain’t you?”
“I reck’n I could eat a hoss. I think I could. How long you ben on de islan’?”
“Since the night I got killed.”
“No! W’y, what has you lived on? But you got a gun. Oh, yes, you got a gun. Dat’s good. Now you kill sumfn en I’ll make up de fire.”
So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the nigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him with his knife, and fried him.
When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot. Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved. Then when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied. By-and-by Jim says:
“But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat ’uz killed in dat shanty ef it warn’t you?”
Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart. He said Tom Sawyer couldn’t get up no better plan than what I had. Then I says:
“How do you come to be here, Jim, and how’d you get here?”
He looked pretty uneasy, and didn’t say nothing for a minute. Then he says:
“Maybe I better not tell.”
“Why, Jim?”
“Well, dey’s reasons. But you wouldn’ tell on me ef I uz to tell you, would you, Huck?”
“Blamed if I would, Jim.”
“Well, I b’lieve you, Huck. I—I run off.”
“Jim!”
“But mind, you said you wouldn’ tell—you know you said you wouldn’ tell, Huck.”
“Well, I did. I said I wouldn’t, and I’ll stick to it. Honest injun, I will. People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for keeping mum—but that don’t make no difference. I ain’t a-going to tell, and I ain’t a-going back there, anyways. So, now, le’s know all about it.”
“Well, you see, it ’uz dis way. Ole missus—dat’s Miss Watson—she pecks on me all de time, en treats me pooty rough, but she awluz said she wouldn’ sell me down to Orleans. But I noticed dey wuz a nigger trader roun’ de place considable lately, en I begin to git oneasy. Well, one night I creeps to de do’ pooty late, en de do’ warn’t quite shet, en I hear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans, but she didn’ want to, but she could git eight hund’d dollars for me, en it ’uz sich a big stack o’ money she couldn’ resis’. De widder she try to git her to say she wouldn’ do it, but I never waited to hear de res’. I lit out mighty quick, I tell you.
“I tuck out en shin down de hill, en ’spec to steal a skift ’long de sho’ som’ers ’bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring yit, so I hid in de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to go ’way. Well, I wuz dah all night. Dey wuz somebody roun’ all de time. ’Long ’bout six in de mawnin’ skifts begin to go by, en ’bout eight er nine every skift dat went ’long wuz talkin’ ’bout how yo’ pap come over to de town en say you’s killed. Dese las’ skifts wuz full o’ ladies en genlmen a-goin’ over for to see de place. Sometimes dey’d pull up at de sho’ en take a res’ b’fo’ dey started acrost, so by de talk I got to know all ’bout de killin’. I ’uz powerful sorry you’s killed, Huck, but I ain’t no mo’ now.
“I laid dah under de shavin’s all day. I ’uz hungry, but I warn’t afeard; bekase I knowed ole missus en de widder wuz goin’ to start to de camp-meet’n’ right arter breakfas’ en be gone all day, en dey knows I goes off wid de cattle ’bout daylight, so dey wouldn’ ’spec to see me roun’ de place, en so dey wouldn’ miss me tell arter dark in de evenin’. De yuther servants wouldn’ miss me, kase dey’d shin out en take holiday soon as de ole folks ’uz out’n de way.
“Well, when it come dark I tuck out up de river road, en went ’bout two mile er more to whah dey warn’t no houses. I’d made up my mine ’bout what I’s agwyne to do. You see, ef I kep’ on tryin’ to git away afoot, de dogs ’ud track me; ef I stole a skift to cross over, dey’d miss dat skift, you see, en dey’d know ’bout whah I’d lan’ on de yuther side, en whah to pick up my track. So I says, a raff is what I’s arter; it doan’ make no track.
“I see a light a-comin’ roun’ de p’int bymeby, so I wade’ in en shove’ a log ahead o’ me en swum more’n half way acrost de river, en got in ’mongst de drift-wood, en kep’ my head down low, en kinder swum agin de current tell de raff come along. Den I swum to de stern uv it en tuck a-holt. It clouded up en ’uz pooty dark for a little while. So I clumb up en laid down on de planks. De men ’uz all ’way yonder in de middle, whah de lantern wuz. De river wuz a-risin’, en dey wuz a good current; so I reck’n’d ’at by fo’ in de mawnin’ I’d be twenty-five mile down de river, en den I’d slip in jis b’fo’ daylight en swim asho’, en take to de woods on de Illinois side.
“But I didn’ have no luck. When we ’uz mos’ down to de head er de islan’ a man begin to come aft wid de lantern, I see it warn’t no use fer to wait, so I slid overboard en struck out fer de islan’. Well, I had a notion I could lan’ mos’ anywhers, but I couldn’t—bank too bluff. I ’uz mos’ to de foot er de islan’ b’fo’ I found’ a good place. I went into de woods en jedged I wouldn’ fool wid raffs no mo’, long as dey move de lantern roun’ so. I had my pipe en a plug er dog-leg, en some matches in my cap, en dey warn’t wet, so I ’uz all right.”
“And so you ain’t had no meat nor bread to eat all this time? Why didn’t you get mud-turkles?”
“How you gwyne to git ’m? You can’t slip up on um en grab um; en how’s a body gwyne to hit um wid a rock? How could a body do it in de night? En I warn’t gwyne to show mysef on de bank in de daytime.”
“Well, that’s so. You’ve had to keep in the woods all the time, of course. Did you hear ’em shooting the cannon?”
“Oh, yes. I knowed dey was arter you. I see um go by heah—watched um thoo de bushes.”
Some young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and lighting. Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain. He said it was a sign when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the same way when young birds done it. I was going to catch some of them, but Jim wouldn’t let me. He said it was death. He said his father laid mighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old granny said his father would die, and he did.
And Jim said you mustn’t count the things you are going to cook for dinner, because that would bring bad luck. The same if you shook the table-cloth after sundown. And he said if a man owned a beehive and that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next morning, or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die. Jim said bees wouldn’t sting idiots; but I didn’t believe that, because I had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn’t sting me.
I had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them. Jim knowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything. I said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked him if there warn’t any good-luck signs. He says:
“Mighty few—an’ dey ain’t no use to a body. What you want to know when good luck’s a-comin’ for? Want to keep it off?” And he said: “Ef you’s got hairy arms en a hairy breas’, it’s a sign dat you’s agwyne to be rich. Well, dey’s some use in a sign like dat, ’kase it’s so fur ahead. You see, maybe you’s got to be po’ a long time fust, en so you might git discourage’ en kill yo’sef ’f you didn’ know by de sign dat you gwyne to be rich bymeby.”
“Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?”
“What’s de use to ax dat question? Don’t you see I has?”
“Well, are you rich?”
“No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin. Wunst I had foteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat’n’, en got busted out.”
“What did you speculate in, Jim?”
“Well, fust I tackled stock.”
“What kind of stock?”
“Why, live stock—cattle, you know. I put ten dollars in a cow. But I ain’ gwyne to resk no mo’ money in stock. De cow up ’n’ died on my han’s.”
“So you lost the ten dollars.”
“No, I didn’t lose it all. I on’y los’ ’bout nine of it. I sole de hide en taller for a dollar en ten cents.”
“You had five dollars and ten cents left. Did you speculate any more?”",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"The passage is about Huck and Jim discussing their time on the island.

They talk about the difficulties Jim faced surviving on the island and his superstitions. Jim recounts his previous experiences with wealth and how he lost his money in poor investments.

“Jim!”
“But mind, you said you wouldn’ tell—you know you said you wouldn’ tell, Huck.”
“Well, I did. I said I wouldn’t, and I’ll stick to it. Honest injun, I will. People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for keeping mum—but that don’t make no difference. I ain’t a-going to tell, and I ain’t a-going back there, anyways. So, now, le’s know all about it.”
“Well, you see, it ’uz dis way. Ole missus—dat’s Miss Watson—she pecks on me all de time, en treats me pooty rough, but she awluz said she wouldn’ sell me down to Orleans. But I noticed dey wuz a nigger trader roun’ de place considable lately, en I begin to git oneasy. Well, one night I creeps to de do’ pooty late, en de do’ warn’t quite shet, en I hear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans, but she didn’ want to, but she could git eight hund’d dollars for me, en it ’uz sich a big stack o’ money she couldn’ resis’. De widder she try to git her to say she wouldn’ do it, but I never waited to hear de res’. I lit out mighty quick, I tell you.
“I tuck out en shin down de hill, en ’spec to steal a skift ’long de sho’ som’ers ’bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring yit, so I hid in de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to go ’way. Well, I wuz dah all night. Dey wuz somebody roun’ all de time. ’Long ’bout six in de mawnin’ skifts begin to go by, en ’bout eight er nine every skift dat went ’long wuz talkin’ ’bout how yo’ pap come over to de town en say you’s killed. Dese las’ skifts wuz full o’ ladies en genlmen a-goin’ over for to see de place. Sometimes dey’d pull up at de sho’ en take a res’ b’fo’ dey started acrost, so by de talk I got to know all ’bout de killin’. I ’uz powerful sorry you’s killed, Huck, but I ain’t no mo’ now.
“I laid dah under de shavin’s all day. I ’uz hungry, but I warn’t afeard; bekase I knowed ole missus en de widder wuz goin’ to start to de camp-meet’n’ right arter breakfas’ en be gone all day, en dey knows I goes off wid de cattle ’bout daylight, so dey wouldn’ ’spec to see me roun’ de place, en so dey wouldn’ miss me tell arter dark in de evenin’. De yuther servants wouldn’ miss me, kase dey’d shin out en take holiday soon as de ole folks ’uz out’n de way.
“Well, when it come dark I tuck out up de river road, en went ’bout two mile er more to whah dey warn’t no houses. I’d made up my mine ’bout what I’s agwyne to do. You see, ef I kep’ on tryin’ to git away afoot, de dogs ’ud track me; ef I stole a skift to cross over, dey’d miss dat skift, you see, en dey’d know ’bout whah I’d lan’ on de yuther side, en whah to pick up my track. So I says, a raff is what I’s arter; it doan’ make no track.
“I see a light a-comin’ roun’ de p’int bymeby, so I wade’ in en shove’ a log ahead o’ me en swum more’n half way acrost de river, en got in ’mongst de drift-wood, en kep’ my head down low, en kinder swum agin de current tell de raff come along. Den I swum to de stern uv it en tuck a-holt. It clouded up en ’uz pooty dark for a little while. So I clumb up en laid down on de planks. De men ’uz all ’way yonder in de middle, whah de lantern wuz. De river wuz a-risin’, en dey wuz a good current; so I reck’n’d ’at by fo’ in de mawnin’ I’d be twenty-five mile down de river, en den I’d slip in jis b’fo’ daylight en swim asho’, en take to de woods on de Illinois side.
“But I didn’ have no luck. When we ’uz mos’ down to de head er de islan’ a man begin to come aft wid de lantern, I see it warn’t no use fer to wait, so I slid overboard en struck out fer de islan’. Well, I had a notion I could lan’ mos’ anywhers, but I couldn’t—bank too bluff. I ’uz mos’ to de foot er de islan’ b’fo’ I found’ a good place. I went into de woods en jedged I wouldn’ fool wid raffs no mo’, long as dey move de lantern roun’ so. I had my pipe en a plug er dog-leg, en some matches in my cap, en dey warn’t wet, so I ’uz all right.”
“And so you ain’t had no meat nor bread to eat all this time? Why didn’t you get mud-turkles?”
“How you gwyne to git ’m? You can’t slip up on um en grab um; en how’s a body gwyne to hit um wid a rock? How could a body do it in de night? En I warn’t gwyne to show mysef on de bank in de daytime.”
“Well, that’s so. You’ve had to keep in the woods all the time, of course. Did you hear ’em shooting the cannon?”
“Oh, yes. I knowed dey was arter you. I see um go by heah—watched um thoo de bushes.”
Some young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and lighting. Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain. He said it was a sign when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the same way when young birds done it. I was going to catch some of them, but Jim wouldn’t let me. He said it was death. He said his father laid mighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old granny said his father would die, and he did.
And Jim said you mustn’t count the things you are going to cook for dinner, because that would bring bad luck. The same if you shook the table-cloth after sundown. And he said if a man owned a beehive and that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next morning, or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die. Jim said bees wouldn’t sting idiots; but I didn’t believe that, because I had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn’t sting me.
I had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them. Jim knowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything. I said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked him if there warn’t any good-luck signs. He says:
“Mighty few—an’ dey ain’t no use to a body. What you want to know when good luck’s a-comin’ for? Want to keep it off?” And he said: “Ef you’s got hairy arms en a hairy breas’, it’s a sign dat you’s agwyne to be rich. Well, dey’s some use in a sign like dat, ’kase it’s so fur ahead. You see, maybe you’s got to be po’ a long time fust, en so you might git discourage’ en kill yo’sef ’f you didn’ know by de sign dat you gwyne to be rich bymeby.”
“Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?”
“What’s de use to ax dat question? Don’t you see I has?”
“Well, are you rich?”
“No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin. Wunst I had foteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat’n’, en got busted out.”
“What did you speculate in, Jim?”
“Well, fust I tackled stock.”
“What kind of stock?”
“Why, live stock—cattle, you know. I put ten dollars in a cow. But I ain’ gwyne to resk no mo’ money in stock. De cow up ’n’ died on my han’s.”
“So you lost the ten dollars.”
“No, I didn’t lose it all. I on’y los’ ’bout nine of it. I sole de hide en taller for a dollar en ten cents.”
“You had five dollars and ten cents left. Did you speculate any more?”",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"The passage is about Huck and Jim discussing their time on the island. Huck informs Jim that he's not dead, and they prepare breakfast together. Jim, who has been on the island since Huck was presumed dead, explains his ordeal and why he ran away from Miss Watson who intended to sell him. They talk about the difficulties Jim faced surviving on the island and his superstitions. Jim recounts his previous experiences with wealth and how he lost his money in poor investments. The conversation reveals their camaraderie and Jim's suspicion of good luck signs.",1838
"Well, I warn’t long making him understand I warn’t dead. I was ever so glad to see Jim. I warn’t lonesome now. I told him I warn’t afraid of him telling the people where I was. I talked along, but he only set there and looked at me; never said nothing. Then I says:
“It’s good daylight. Le’s get breakfast. Make up your camp fire good.”
“What’s de use er makin’ up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich truck? But you got a gun, hain’t you? Den we kin git sumfn better den strawbries.”
“Strawberries and such truck,” I says. “Is that what you live on?”
“I couldn’ git nuffn else,” he says.
“Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?”
“I come heah de night arter you’s killed.”
“What, all that time?”
“Yes—indeedy.”
“And ain’t you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?”
“No, sah—nuffn else.”
“Well, you must be most starved, ain’t you?”
“I reck’n I could eat a hoss. I think I could. How long you ben on de islan’?”
“Since the night I got killed.”
“No! W’y, what has you lived on? But you got a gun. Oh, yes, you got a gun. Dat’s good. Now you kill sumfn en I’ll make up de fire.”
So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the nigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him with his knife, and fried him.
When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot. Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved. Then when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied. By-and-by Jim says:
“But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat ’uz killed in dat shanty ef it warn’t you?”
Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart. He said Tom Sawyer couldn’t get up no better plan than what I had. Then I says:
“How do you come to be here, Jim, and how’d you get here?”
He looked pretty uneasy, and didn’t say nothing for a minute. Then he says:
“Maybe I better not tell.”
“Why, Jim?”
“Well, dey’s reasons. But you wouldn’ tell on me ef I uz to tell you, would you, Huck?”
“Blamed if I would, Jim.”
“Well, I b’lieve you, Huck. I—I run off.”
“Jim!”
“But mind, you said you wouldn’ tell—you know you said you wouldn’ tell, Huck.”
“Well, I did. I said I wouldn’t, and I’ll stick to it. Honest injun, I will. People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for keeping mum—but that don’t make no difference. I ain’t a-going to tell, and I ain’t a-going back there, anyways. So, now, le’s know all about it.”

"I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn’t do it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking—thinking how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell. And went on thinking. And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I couldn’t seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the other kind. I’d see him standing my watch on top of his’n, ’stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the only one he’s got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.
It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was a-trembling, because I’d got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself:
“All right, then, I’ll go to hell”—and tore it up.
It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again, which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn’t. And for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again; and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.
Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that suited me. So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in. I slept the night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast, and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore. I landed below where I judged was Phelps’s place, and hid my bundle in the woods, and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.
Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it, “Phelps’s Sawmill,” and when I come to the farm-houses, two or three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn’t see nobody around, though it was good daylight now. But I didn’t mind, because I didn’t want to see nobody just yet—I only wanted to get the lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from the village, not from below. So I just took a look, and shoved along, straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was the duke. He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch—three-night performance—like that other time. They had the cheek, them frauds! I was right on him before I could shirk. He looked astonished, and says:
“Hel-lo! Where’d you come from?” Then he says, kind of glad and eager, “Where’s the raft?—got her in a good place?”
I says:
“Why, that’s just what I was going to ask your grace.”
Then he didn’t look so joyful, and says:
“What was your idea for asking me?” he says.
“Well,” I says, “when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says to myself, we can’t get him home for hours, till he’s soberer; so I went a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait. A man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat, and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after him. We didn’t have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out. We never got him till dark; then we fetched him over, and I started down for the raft. When I got there and see it was gone, I says to myself, ‘they’ve got into trouble and had to leave; and they’ve took my nigger, which is the only nigger I’ve got in the world, and now I’m in a strange country, and ain’t got no property no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;’ so I set down and cried. I slept in the woods all night. But what did become of the raft, then?—and Jim—poor Jim!”
“Blamed if I know—that is, what’s become of the raft. That old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but what he’d spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and found the raft gone, we said, ‘That little rascal has stole our raft and shook us, and run off down the river.’”
“I wouldn’t shake my nigger, would I?—the only nigger I had in the world, and the only property.”
“We never thought of that. Fact is, I reckon we’d come to consider him our nigger; yes, we did consider him so—goodness knows we had trouble enough for him. So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke, there warn’t anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another shake. And I’ve pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn. Where’s that ten cents? Give it here.”",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"In this passage, the protagonist reflects on his moral dilemma and memories with Jim, a runaway slave.

When I got there and see it was gone, I says to myself, ‘they’ve got into trouble and had to leave; and they’ve took my nigger, which is the only nigger I’ve got in the world, and now I’m in a strange country, and ain’t got no property no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;’ so I set down and cried.

"I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn’t do it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking—thinking how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell. And went on thinking. And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I couldn’t seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the other kind. I’d see him standing my watch on top of his’n, ’stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the only one he’s got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.
It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was a-trembling, because I’d got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself:
“All right, then, I’ll go to hell”—and tore it up.
It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again, which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn’t. And for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again; and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.
Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that suited me. So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in. I slept the night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast, and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore. I landed below where I judged was Phelps’s place, and hid my bundle in the woods, and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.
Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it, “Phelps’s Sawmill,” and when I come to the farm-houses, two or three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn’t see nobody around, though it was good daylight now. But I didn’t mind, because I didn’t want to see nobody just yet—I only wanted to get the lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from the village, not from below. So I just took a look, and shoved along, straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was the duke. He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch—three-night performance—like that other time. They had the cheek, them frauds! I was right on him before I could shirk. He looked astonished, and says:
“Hel-lo! Where’d you come from?” Then he says, kind of glad and eager, “Where’s the raft?—got her in a good place?”
I says:
“Why, that’s just what I was going to ask your grace.”
Then he didn’t look so joyful, and says:
“What was your idea for asking me?” he says.
“Well,” I says, “when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says to myself, we can’t get him home for hours, till he’s soberer; so I went a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait. A man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat, and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after him.

"DON'T you like getting presents? I do. Birthdays and Christmas are always enjoyable times. We love receiving surprise presents. I remember visiting a house in the country once, and a little boy and girl of the house came into my room when my luggage was being unpacked, and eyed everything being taken out of my bag and boxes with the greatest interest. At last they could keep silent no longer.
""And what have you brought us?"" they asked.
I was filled with confusion, for I had brought them nothing. I had not known of their existence. Their expectations were disappointed.
Another little boy of my acquaintance came to lunch with me one day. His mother was with him, and I think had talked to him beforehand about being on his best behaviour. I had got a toy for him to amuse himself with, and he had a very good time after lunch playing with it.
When he was going away, I told him he could take it with him. ""I'll make you a present of it,"" I said.
To my surprise, he put his hands behind his back, and said, ""Oh, no, thank you.""
""Don't you want it?"" I asked.
He shook his head, though he eyed it lovingly.
""I assure you, your mother will like you to have it,"" I said.
But nothing would induce him to take it, and he went away without it.
I fancy he was trying to be extra good. He thought it was not good manners to take a present away.
""What a silly boy!"" you say.
But we often act like that with God. And it is such a pity, for we lose so much by not stretching out our hands to take what He offers us.
We may have a present offered us, but if we won't put out our hands to take it, what is the good of it to us? And how ungrateful to the kind giver!
Sometimes people get unsuitable presents. I heard of a little girl who bought a tiny doll's tea-set, and gave it to her mother as a birthday present.
And a scholarly old bachelor uncle gave his little nephew on his seventh birthday a Latin book, ""Virgil's Aeneid.""
We can fancy that neither of these presents was suitable!
Now God knows exactly what we want, and He gives us everything suitable to our age and circumstances. But there is one gift that is wanted by everybody, big and small, rich and poor. Many of the gifts we get in this world, wear out, and come to an end; this one cannot come to an end. And it is the gift that God likes to give us.
Some presents cost a lot of money. This one cost Somebody His life to get, and that makes it the most valuable gift in the whole world.
In the time of slavery, there was an old negro woman who had a son whom she loved very dearly. She and he lived and worked on a sugar plantation in the West Indies, for they were both slaves. But at that time some of the slave owners would allow their slaves to purchase their freedom, and though it cost them a great deal of money, some freed themselves in this way. It was this old woman's one desire in life to work overtime, save her money, and free her son from bondage.
She did not tell him what she was doing but she worked when he was asleep—and never took any rest or holiday herself. The consequence was, she ruined her health, and after many years of this dreadfully hard laborious life, she broke down, and had to take to her bed. But by that time she had earned the money to buy the freedom of her son. She called him one night to her dying bed, and produced a canvas bag.
""Here,"" she said, ""is money to set you free, my son. You will never be a slave any more. I have worked all my life to get it, and now I have got the money, I die in peace.""
She died in her son's arms—and he felt that his freedom had cost his mother her life.
Now the gift that God offers to us all cost the Lord Jesus Christ His life, and it is only through Him—or because of Him that we can get it.

"In the year 1653 there come sad news to Ellswether. My Lord Brandon, heading a rising for the young king in the North, was taken and beheaded; and my lady his wife, who had wearied herself in vain to obtain his pardon, died after giving birth to a daughter. Their son and heir had died in his infancy, and the barony must needs descend to a distant cousin of my lord’s, that was a boon companion of the king in France and Flanders. My lord’s estates and property was all confiscated, and for the poor babe was nothing left, save that she might have my lady’s gowns and suchlike. My lady had committed her babe to the charge of the gentlewoman that bare her company, desiring that she should be brought to Ellswether, and bred up by my mother. Wherefore this gentlewoman, Mrs Sophronia Skipwith by name, took with her the babe, together with my lady’s gowns and jewels, and the great portraits of her and my lord which he had had painted for her on their wedding, and divers tomes of French and English romances, and started on her journey. Coming to Ellswether, she found there sore lamentation, for that my dear mother had departed this life two days before. And Sir Harry, my father, finding himself with my Lady Brandon’s babe to keep, and discerning Mrs Skipwith to be a gentlewoman of most discreet conversation and a sobriety suiting her years (which were thirty-five at the least, and rather over than under), did offer her to remain as governess to the babe, the rather as the aforesaid Mrs Skipwith was an orphan and a distant kinswoman of my lady’s. Now if you look to hear that Mrs Skipwith made use of Sir Harry’s kindness to creep into his good graces, and thus marry him thereafter, you shall be disappointed, for she behaved herself throughout her life with a rare discreetness and wisdom, and hath left behind her a memory full of praise.
My good father, then, adopted for his own the little Mrs Dorothy Brandon (whose kinsman, even after the happy Restoration of his majesty King Charles II., when he gat back his lands, never troubled himself to inquire after her, lest for very shame he must settle on her a portion out of the estates of my lord her father), my father, I say, adopted her, intending in due time to marry her to me his son, and we grew up together as brother and sister, but in that prospect. Now at the Restoration, as I have said, there was many received back their confiscated lands, but my father, who (with his brothers) had sold and mortgaged all for the king’s service, gat nothing, since he had done it all willingly. There remained to us, then, only the manor of Ellswether itself, whereon was a heavy mortgage, that was fallen into the hands of Mr Sternhold, the attorney that my grandfather had been wont to employ. And again, if you look to hear in this place that Mr Sternhold proved himself a cruel or an unrighteous creditor, you will again receive a disappointment, for sure there was never no man that served better either the father or the absent son. But if this great burden of the mortgage was to be removed, it was needful for me to make my fortune, and this in no unspeedy way. And if you shall be surprised that my father allowed me, his only son, to undertake such a distant and dangerous manner of life as that I have followed, I would have you remember that Sir Harry, as was but natural in a gentleman of his family and breeding, cared more for the honour and name of the house than for him that might one day bear it, and that he sent me forth in quest of wealth for to redeem the estates, as any father in Rome might have sent forth his son in quest of warlike honour. After this explanation, which I trust shall resolve any matters that might otherwise seem to you obscure or contradictory, I will proceed to my tale.
Since I have spoke to you of my father’s poverty, you will readily perceive that he could not send me to any great school, nor was he likely, in the dark days that then shadowed this poor realm of ours, to commit me to the tuition of the schismatical minister that had usurped the room of the vicar of our parish, wherefore he was constrained to send me by the day to the grammar-school of Puckle Acton, which town lieth in the vicinage of Ellswether. Here, in common with the sons of many gentlemen of the country round, I gained a slight acquaintance with Greek and Latin, and (for which my life hath made me far more grateful) such a knowledge of the art of fence, of boxing and shooting, as hath often stood me in good stead. When I was not at the school, the time did often hang heavy for me, for the gentlemen’s sons of whom I have spoken durst not admit me to their company more than rarely, for fear of the suspicions of our tyrants, that were wont to scent a conjuration or conspiracy whensoever any number of Malignants (for so they called us) was met together. The company of the boys of the town I neither sought nor would my father have permitted me so to do, and I came thus, almost of necessity, to use and enjoy that of my little cousin Dorothy Brandon, in all my holidays and times of rest. ’Twas with her I learned from Mrs Skipwith to read French, and we loved to pore together over the pages of the ‘Grand Cyrus,’ that magazine of brave thoughts and witty conceits, of the ‘Cleopâtre’ and of the ‘Clélie.’ Of English books we had no great store, but in Sir Philip Sidney his ‘Arcadia’ and in Mr Lyly’s ‘Euphues’ we found a rare delight. Add to this, that my little cousin taught herself Latin in order to the reading it with me, and (her youth remembered) was no mean scholar in the Greek, and you shall see that we had no lack of fantastic and heroical reading for to divert ourselves withal.",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"In 1653, Lord Brandon was executed for supporting the young king, and his wife died after childbirth, leaving their baby daughter Dorothy orphaned. The family's estate was confiscated, and Lady Brandon's distant relative, Mrs. Sophronia Skipwith, brought Dorothy to Ellswether as per Lady Brandon's wishes, where Sir Harry decided to raise her. Although Sir Harry faced financial struggles, including a mortgaged manor, he adopted Dorothy with the intention of her marrying his son. Despite the hardships, Sir Harry sent his son to a local grammar school where he learned various skills. The son of Sir Harry and Dorothy grew close, educating themselves in French, Latin, Greek, and indulging in romantic literature. Sir Harry's priority was the family's honor, driving his son to seek fortune.",1055

My good father, then, adopted for his own the little Mrs Dorothy Brandon (whose kinsman, even after the happy Restoration of his majesty King Charles II., when he gat back his lands, never troubled himself to inquire after her, lest for very shame he must settle on her a portion out of the estates of my lord her father), my father, I say, adopted her, intending in due time to marry her to me his son, and we grew up together as brother and sister, but in that prospect. Now at the Restoration, as I have said, there was many received back their confiscated lands, but my father, who (with his brothers) had sold and mortgaged all for the king’s service, gat nothing, since he had done it all willingly. There remained to us, then, only the manor of Ellswether itself, whereon was a heavy mortgage, that was fallen into the hands of Mr Sternhold, the attorney that my grandfather had been wont to employ. And again, if you look to hear in this place that Mr Sternhold proved himself a cruel or an unrighteous creditor, you will again receive a disappointment, for sure there was never no man that served better either the father or the absent son. But if this great burden of the mortgage was to be removed, it was needful for me to make my fortune, and this in no unspeedy way. And if you shall be surprised that my father allowed me, his only son, to undertake such a distant and dangerous manner of life as that I have followed, I would have you remember that Sir Harry, as was but natural in a gentleman of his family and breeding, cared more for the honour and name of the house than for him that might one day bear it, and that he sent me forth in quest of wealth for to redeem the estates, as any father in Rome might have sent forth his son in quest of warlike honour. After this explanation, which I trust shall resolve any matters that might otherwise seem to you obscure or contradictory, I will proceed to my tale.
Since I have spoke to you of my father’s poverty, you will readily perceive that he could not send me to any great school, nor was he likely, in the dark days that then shadowed this poor realm of ours, to commit me to the tuition of the schismatical minister that had usurped the room of the vicar of our parish, wherefore he was constrained to send me by the day to the grammar-school of Puckle Acton, which town lieth in the vicinage of Ellswether. Here, in common with the sons of many gentlemen of the country round, I gained a slight acquaintance with Greek and Latin, and (for which my life hath made me far more grateful) such a knowledge of the art of fence, of boxing and shooting, as hath often stood me in good stead. When I was not at the school, the time did often hang heavy for me, for the gentlemen’s sons of whom I have spoken durst not admit me to their company more than rarely, for fear of the suspicions of our tyrants, that were wont to scent a conjuration or conspiracy whensoever any number of Malignants (for so they called us) was met together. The company of the boys of the town I neither sought nor would my father have permitted me so to do, and I came thus, almost of necessity, to use and enjoy that of my little cousin Dorothy Brandon, in all my holidays and times of rest. ’Twas with her I learned from Mrs Skipwith to read French, and we loved to pore together over the pages of the ‘Grand Cyrus,’ that magazine of brave thoughts and witty conceits, of the ‘Cleopâtre’ and of the ‘Clélie.’ Of English books we had no great store, but in Sir Philip Sidney his ‘Arcadia’ and in Mr Lyly’s ‘Euphues’ we found a rare delight.

"In the year 1655 there come sad news to Ellswether. My Lord Brandon, heading a rising for the young king in the North, was taken and beheaded; and my lady his wife, who had wearied herself in vain to obtain his pardon, died after giving birth to a daughter. Their son and heir had died in his infancy, and the barony must needs descend to a distant cousin of my lord’s, that was a boon companion of the king in France and Flanders. My lord’s estates and property was all confiscated, and for the poor babe was nothing left, save that she might have my lady’s gowns and suchlike. My lady had committed her babe to the charge of the gentlewoman that bare her company, desiring that she should be brought to Ellswether, and bred up by my mother. Wherefore this gentlewoman, Mrs Sophronia Skipwith by name, took with her the babe, together with my lady’s gowns and jewels, and the great portraits of her and my lord which he had had painted for her on their wedding, and divers tomes of French and English romances, and started on her journey. Coming to Ellswether, she found there sore lamentation, for that my dear mother had departed this life two days before. And Sir Harry, my father, finding himself with my Lady Brandon’s babe to keep, and discerning Mrs Skipwith to be a gentlewoman of most discreet conversation and a sobriety suiting her years (which were thirty-five at the least, and rather over than under), did offer her to remain as governess to the babe, the rather as the aforesaid Mrs Skipwith was an orphan and a distant kinswoman of my lady’s.

"We could see Jacobsdal from the Weltufrede farm, a few buildings on the banks of a brook, and a neat little church, being all that this embryo town of the western Transvaal had then to show. After leaving it we turned north, then north-east towards Zeerust, the most important settlement in the[22] Marico district. On our way thither we passed one of the most productive farms in the neighbourhood; it belonged to a man named Bootha, and was traversed by the Malmani, which wound its way through a low rocky ridge to its junction with the Marico.
I made a preliminary visit by myself to the little town, but we did not actually move our quarters into Zeerust till next day. It covers a larger area than Jacobsdal, and any one devoted to natural science would find abundant material to interest him in its vicinity.

The following day I employed myself in drawing out a sketch-map of my route, and when I had completed it, I amused myself by an inspection of the plantations and gardens which surround the mission-station. I attended the chapel, where the service consisted of a hymn, the reading of a portion of one of the gospels, then another hymn, followed by a sermon; the impression made upon the congregation as they squatted on their low wooden stools being very marked, and the whole service in its very simplicity being to my mind as solemn as the most gorgeous ritual.

"Dr. Rawlings sighed a long sigh born of frustration and impatience and went wearily to the bookcase. Almost methodically he removed a large gold-titled volume of Freud's A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis and withdrew the bottle from its hiding place. The bottle was half filled with an amber fluid which jiggled pleasantly as he held it in an unsteady hand, observing with a practiced eye how gaily it sparkled in the late afternoon sunlight. Then from the cavity he also extracted a small whiskey glass.
He took these tools to his desk, poured himself a stiff one, downed it, flopped into his swivel chair and closed his eyes. Chicken farms, he thought. He felt the fiery liquid seep through him, warming his insides with its silent flame, bringing a pleasant glow of satisfaction to his mind.
He closed his eyes tighter and regarded the darkened world with a calmness that was somehow conducive to rational thought even in this irrational world. To thought and to sleep, he realized suddenly, as he found his head tilting.
He rose quickly, blinking off the effects of the liquor, and carefully returned the utensils to their proper niche behind the volume of Freud on the bookshelf. Good old Freud, he thought, always knew he'd come in handy one of these days. Then he returned to his desk to consult a small pad, and silently cursed the cruel fates that had given him patients tumbling upon one another in a ridiculously mad haste to reach the jumbled sanity of the normal world.
Why couldn't there have been a decent interval of time between them, so he could take a shower, or have a game of golf, or maybe even hang on a small one, or see a psychiatrist himself. Or maybe start that chicken farm he'd been talking about for the past two years.
He jabbed a button, said into the intercom, ""Miss Austin, will you please send in the file on Mr. Charles T. Moore?""—and without waiting for an answer snapped the machine off.
Fifteen seconds later the door opened and Miss Austin walked in, a Manila folder in one lovely hand. As usual she was in an immaculately white uniform. White for purity? he wondered. It was a tight-fitting garment that clung to every curve as though hanging on for dear life, and on second thought he mentally erased the purity inscription on his mind's slate.
Miss Austin had a beautiful walk, and beautiful legs to walk on. He stared at them as she approached the desk. He always stared at them, fascinated, and she always knew he did, and she smiled that enticingly mad smile of hers that always made him want to give vent to an emotional catharsis.
God, he thought, how I'd love to psychoanalyze that woman! What a beautiful ego she must have. What a gorgeous id.
Carefully she deposited the folder on his desk, leaning forward strategically so her perfume could glide over him in intoxicating currents.
""Will that be all, Doctor Rawlings?"" she asked in her honey-liquid tones.
""For now,"" he said, reaching for her hand and finding it. ""But don't go away.""
She smiled again, and gently freeing her hand, swept from the room. She looked even better from the back, if that were possible; after a few seconds deliberation he decided it wasn't possible. But it was women like Miss Austin that made him want a chicken farm, among other things. Miss Austin and a little tract of land far out in the country would be just perfect. In such a paradise he wouldn't even have to worry about the pecking order of hens. In fact, he might even get engrossed in raising things other than chickens.
Sighing again, he studied the folder before him, which did not take very long. The patient was still quite young even though he had already made a mark of sorts on the world. A theoretical mathematician, apparently. Probably thought himself a square circle on an adding machine. The psychiatrist browsed through the folder's contents again, then jabbed the buzzer.
""You can send Mr. Moore in now,"" he said and snapped the intercom off before Miss Austin could answer. The present moment was no time to be distracted.
Dr. Rawlings held his head in his hands and stared morosely at the desk. Then he picked up a pencil and began tapping it against an inkwell. An incongruous thought surely, pencil and inkwell—what would Freud say about that?
He decided in the same thought that he didn't give a particular damn what Freud thought about inkwells. There were times in fact when he didn't care what Freud thought about anything. There were times when all we wanted to think about was a small chicken farm, with maybe a gorgeous honey-blonde like Miss Austin to help sow a few seeds.
He looked out the window at the sky and the tops of buildings, and recalled with bitterness the patient who had claimed that he could fly, and who had tried to jump to the street forty floors below solely to prove it. It would have made a nasty splash, he thought. All the king's horses and all the king's men—Unless, of course, the patient really could fly....
He looked up, annoyed, and discovered that the door had not opened. Furiously, he jabbed the buzzer again. ""Isn't Mr. Moore here yet?"" he demanded, consulting his watch. ""He was supposed to be here five minutes ago.""
""He's here, Doctor,"" the receptionist's silk-and-satin tones came. ""He's trying to get up enough courage to open the door.""
""Oh,"" the psychiatrist said. He felt like adding something unprofessional, but he controlled himself. With an effort he shut off the intercom and just waited.
He looked up at the door and saw the knob turning slowly, ever so slowly. He watched its glistening facets turn in the dim natural lighting of the room, rotating as though in the slowest of slow motions.
He sighed and turned his attention to his desk top, where he discovered he had abstractedly pencilled on the blotter a four letter word not normally used in polite society. Hastily, annoyed with himself, he grabbed the pencil and used its erasing head to rub off the offending word.
When he looked up again, the door had opened the slightest crack. Damn, he thought, this job is going to drive me whacky yet. He recalled an episode of a few weeks earlier. He didn't want to, but the thought came just the same. Some of his patients had delusions so logical and systematized it was hard to prove to them that they were wrong. Sometimes it was hard to prove to yourself they were not right after all.
The woman from Mars, for example. She had actually believed that she was from the fourth planet, was really a Martian stranded here unaccountably. She had told a good straight story, but he had managed to convince her that she was not from Mars. He had persuaded her that she was an Earthling like everybody else, and that space travel of any sort was utterly impossible anyway.
He had been about to prove that there was probably no such planet as Mars when she'd decided not to come back. That was close to the time the meteorite landed a few miles away, the one that had never been found. After all, while not a usual occurrence, over-developed lungs and six fingers on each hand didn't mean—
The door edged open slightly, and an eye peered fearfully into the room. Then it swung wide, and the young man standing in the doorway let out a blastfurnace sigh that could be heard in surrounding offices.
""Come in, Mr. Moore,"" the psychiatrist said, ""come in, close the door, sit down.""
Mr. Moore did all these things with normal speed and in the proper order, but he did have a tendency to sit on the edge of his chair, as though he were sitting on a cliff and might topple over at any moment. The psychiatrist doodled on his pad impatiently.
""Well now, just what seems to be the trouble?""
Mr. Moore wet his lips. His face was white. He said, ""I'm a mathematician. I work at the University.""
""Oh,"" the other said, bringing to voice facts he'd read a few minutes before. ""You're that Charles T. Moore, the one whose picture was in the paper a short time ago. Something about mathematics, I remember.""
Moore nodded.
""Einstein, wasn't it?"" the psychiatrist mused. ""Something I don't understand, Einstein.""
""It's not easy,"" Moore agreed. ""That's what started my difficulty.""",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"Dr. Rawlings, a weary and frustrated psychiatrist, indulges in a hidden stash of whiskey to cope with his demanding job and turbulent thoughts whenever he can.

He closed his eyes tighter and regarded the darkened world with a calmness that was somehow conducive to rational thought even in this irrational world. To thought and to sleep, he realized suddenly, as he found his head tilting.
He rose quickly, blinking off the effects of the liquor, and carefully returned the utensils to their proper niche behind the volume of Freud on the bookshelf. Good old Freud, he thought, always knew he'd come in handy one of these days. Then he returned to his desk to consult a small pad, and silently cursed the cruel fates that had given him patients tumbling upon one another in a ridiculously mad haste to reach the jumbled sanity of the normal world.
Why couldn't there have been a decent interval of time between them, so he could take a shower, or have a game of golf, or maybe even hang on a small one, or see a psychiatrist himself. Or maybe start that chicken farm he'd been talking about for the past two years.
He jabbed a button, said into the intercom, ""Miss Austin, will you please send in the file on Mr. Charles T. Moore?""—and without waiting for an answer snapped the machine off.
Fifteen seconds later the door opened and Miss Austin walked in, a Manila folder in one lovely hand. As usual she was in an immaculately white uniform. White for purity? he wondered. It was a tight-fitting garment that clung to every curve as though hanging on for dear life, and on second thought he mentally erased the purity inscription on his mind's slate.
Miss Austin had a beautiful walk, and beautiful legs to walk on. He stared at them as she approached the desk. He always stared at them, fascinated, and she always knew he did, and she smiled that enticingly mad smile of hers that always made him want to give vent to an emotional catharsis.
God, he thought, how I'd love to psychoanalyze that woman! What a beautiful ego she must have. What a gorgeous id.
Carefully she deposited the folder on his desk, leaning forward strategically so her perfume could glide over him in intoxicating currents.
""Will that be all, Doctor Rawlings?"" she asked in her honey-liquid tones.
""For now,"" he said, reaching for her hand and finding it. ""But don't go away.""
She smiled again, and gently freeing her hand, swept from the room. She looked even better from the back, if that were possible; after a few seconds deliberation he decided it wasn't possible. But it was women like Miss Austin that made him want a chicken farm, among other things. Miss Austin and a little tract of land far out in the country would be just perfect. In such a paradise he wouldn't even have to worry about the pecking order of hens. In fact, he might even get engrossed in raising things other than chickens.
Sighing again, he studied the folder before him, which did not take very long. The patient was still quite young even though he had already made a mark of sorts on the world. A theoretical mathematician, apparently. Probably thought himself a square circle on an adding machine. The psychiatrist browsed through the folder's contents again, then jabbed the buzzer.
""You can send Mr. Moore in now,"" he said and snapped the intercom off before Miss Austin could answer. The present moment was no time to be distracted.
Dr. Rawlings held his head in his hands and stared morosely at the desk. Then he picked up a pencil and began tapping it against an inkwell. An incongruous thought surely, pencil and inkwell—what would Freud say about that?
He decided in the same thought that he didn't give a particular damn what Freud thought about inkwells. There were times in fact when he didn't care what Freud thought about anything. There were times when all we wanted to think about was a small chicken farm, with maybe a gorgeous honey-blonde like Miss Austin to help sow a few seeds.
He looked out the window at the sky and the tops of buildings, and recalled with bitterness the patient who had claimed that he could fly, and who had tried to jump to the street forty floors below solely to prove it. It would have made a nasty splash, he thought. All the king's horses and all the king's men—Unless, of course, the patient really could fly....
He looked up, annoyed, and discovered that the door had not opened. Furiously, he jabbed the buzzer again. ""Isn't Mr. Moore here yet?"" he demanded, consulting his watch. ""He was supposed to be here five minutes ago.""
""He's here, Doctor,"" the receptionist's silk-and-satin tones came. ""He's trying to get up enough courage to open the door.""
""Oh,"" the psychiatrist said. He felt like adding something unprofessional, but he controlled himself. With an effort he shut off the intercom and just waited.
He looked up at the door and saw the knob turning slowly, ever so slowly. He watched its glistening facets turn in the dim natural lighting of the room, rotating as though in the slowest of slow motions.
He sighed and turned his attention to his desk top, where he discovered he had abstractedly pencilled on the blotter a four letter word not normally used in polite society. Hastily, annoyed with himself, he grabbed the pencil and used its erasing head to rub off the offending word.
When he looked up again, the door had opened the slightest crack. Damn, he thought, this job is going to drive me whacky yet. He recalled an episode of a few weeks earlier. He didn't want to, but the thought came just the same. Some of his patients had delusions so logical and systematized it was hard to prove to them that they were wrong. Sometimes it was hard to prove to yourself they were not right after all.
The woman from Mars, for example. She had actually believed that she was from the fourth planet, was really a Martian stranded here unaccountably. She had told a good straight story, but he had managed to convince her that she was not from Mars. He had persuaded her that she was an Earthling like everybody else, and that space travel of any sort was utterly impossible anyway.
He had been about to prove that there was probably no such planet as Mars when she'd decided not to come back. That was close to the time the meteorite landed a few miles away, the one that had never been found. After all, while not a usual occurrence, over-developed lungs and six fingers on each hand didn't mean—
The door edged open slightly, and an eye peered fearfully into the room. Then it swung wide, and the young man standing in the doorway let out a blastfurnace sigh that could be heard in surrounding offices.
""Come in, Mr. Moore,"" the psychiatrist said, ""come in, close the door, sit down.""
Mr. Moore did all these things with normal speed and in the proper order, but he did have a tendency to sit on the edge of his chair, as though he were sitting on a cliff and might topple over at any moment. The psychiatrist doodled on his pad impatiently.
""Well now, just what seems to be the trouble?""
Mr. Moore wet his lips. His face was white. He said, ""I'm a mathematician. I work at the University.""
""Oh,"" the other said, bringing to voice facts he'd read a few minutes before. ""You're that Charles T. Moore, the one whose picture was in the paper a short time ago. Something about mathematics, I remember.""
Moore nodded.
""Einstein, wasn't it?"" the psychiatrist mused. ""Something I don't understand, Einstein.""
""It's not easy,"" Moore agreed. ""That's what started my difficulty.""",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"Dr. Rawlings, a weary and frustrated psychiatrist, indulges in a hidden stash of whiskey to cope with his demanding job and turbulent thoughts whenever he can.

"Dr. Rawlings sighed a long sigh born of frustration and impatience and went wearily to the bookcase. Almost methodically he removed a large gold-titled volume of Freud's A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis and withdrew the bottle from its hiding place. The bottle was half filled with an amber fluid which jiggled pleasantly as he held it in an unsteady hand, observing with a practiced eye how gaily it sparkled in the late afternoon sunlight. Then from the cavity he also extracted a small whiskey glass.
He took these tools to his desk, poured himself a stiff one, downed it, flopped into his swivel chair and closed his eyes. Chicken farms, he thought. He felt the fiery liquid seep through him, warming his insides with its silent flame, bringing a pleasant glow of satisfaction to his mind.

"An elegant carriage stood in the middle of the road with a pair of spirited grey horses; there was no one in it, and the coachman had got off his box and stood by; the horses were being held by the bridle.... A mass of people had gathered round, the police standing in front. One of them held a lighted lantern which he was turning on something lying close to the wheels. Everyone was talking, shouting, exclaiming; the coachman seemed at a loss and kept repeating:
“What a misfortune! Good Lord, what a misfortune!”
Raskolnikov pushed his way in as far as he could, and succeeded at last in seeing the object of the commotion and interest. On the ground a man who had been run over lay apparently unconscious, and covered with blood; he was very badly dressed, but not like a workman. Blood was flowing from his head and face; his face was crushed, mutilated and disfigured. He was evidently badly injured.
“Merciful heaven!” wailed the coachman, “what more could I do? If I’d been driving fast or had not shouted to him, but I was going quietly, not in a hurry. Everyone could see I was going along just like everybody else. A drunken man can’t walk straight, we all know.... I saw him crossing the street, staggering and almost falling. I shouted again and a second and a third time, then I held the horses in, but he fell straight under their feet! Either he did it on purpose or he was very tipsy.... The horses are young and ready to take fright... they started, he screamed... that made them worse. That’s how it happened!”
“That’s just how it was,” a voice in the crowd confirmed.
“He shouted, that’s true, he shouted three times,” another voice declared.
“Three times it was, we all heard it,” shouted a third.
But the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened. It was evident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person who was awaiting it somewhere; the police, of course, were in no little anxiety to avoid upsetting his arrangements. All they had to do was to take the injured man to the police station and the hospital. No one knew his name.
Meanwhile Raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped closer over him. The lantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate man’s face. He recognised him.
“I know him! I know him!” he shouted, pushing to the front. “It’s a government clerk retired from the service, Marmeladov. He lives close by in Kozel’s house.... Make haste for a doctor! I will pay, see?” He pulled money out of his pocket and showed it to the policeman. He was in violent agitation.
The police were glad that they had found out who the man was. Raskolnikov gave his own name and address, and, as earnestly as if it had been his father, he besought the police to carry the unconscious Marmeladov to his lodging at once.
“Just here, three houses away,” he said eagerly, “the house belongs to Kozel, a rich German. He was going home, no doubt drunk. I know him, he is a drunkard. He has a family there, a wife, children, he has one daughter.... It will take time to take him to the hospital, and there is sure to be a doctor in the house. I’ll pay, I’ll pay! At least he will be looked after at home... they will help him at once. But he’ll die before you get him to the hospital.” He managed to slip something unseen into the policeman’s hand. But the thing was straightforward and legitimate, and in any case help was closer here. They raised the injured man; people volunteered to help.
Kozel’s house was thirty yards away. Raskolnikov walked behind, carefully holding Marmeladov’s head and showing the way.
“This way, this way! We must take him upstairs head foremost. Turn round! I’ll pay, I’ll make it worth your while,” he muttered.
Katerina Ivanovna had just begun, as she always did at every free moment, walking to and fro in her little room from window to stove and back again, with her arms folded across her chest, talking to herself and coughing. Of late she had begun to talk more than ever to her eldest girl, Polenka, a child of ten, who, though there was much she did not understand, understood very well that her mother needed her, and so always watched her with her big clever eyes and strove her utmost to appear to understand. This time Polenka was undressing her little brother, who had been unwell all day and was going to bed. The boy was waiting for her to take off his shirt, which had to be washed at night. He was sitting straight and motionless on a chair, with a silent, serious face, with his legs stretched out straight before him—heels together and toes turned out.
He was listening to what his mother was saying to his sister, sitting perfectly still with pouting lips and wide-open eyes, just as all good little boys have to sit when they are undressed to go to bed. A little girl, still younger, dressed literally in rags, stood at the screen, waiting for her turn. The door on to the stairs was open to relieve them a little from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the other rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in the poor, consumptive woman. Katerina Ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinner during that week and the hectic flush on her face was brighter than ever.
“You wouldn’t believe, you can’t imagine, Polenka,” she said, walking about the room, “what a happy luxurious life we had in my papa’s house and how this drunkard has brought me, and will bring you all, to ruin! Papa was a civil colonel and only a step from being a governor; so that everyone who came to see him said, ‘We look upon you, Ivan Mihailovitch, as our governor!’ When I... when...” she coughed violently, “oh, cursed life,” she cried, clearing her throat and pressing her hands to her breast, “when I... when at the last ball... at the marshal’s...

That other was your father, Polya; papa was fearfully angry.... Is the water ready? Give me the shirt, and the stockings! Lida,” said she to the youngest one, “you must manage without your chemise to-night... and lay your stockings out with it... I’ll wash them together.... How is it that drunken vagabond doesn’t come in? He has worn his shirt till it looks like a dish-clout, he has torn it to rags! I’d do it all together, so as not to have to work two nights running!

I shouted again and a second and a third time, then I held the horses in, but he fell straight under their feet! Either he did it on purpose or he was very tipsy.... The horses are young and ready to take fright... they started, he screamed... that made them worse. That’s how it happened!”
“That’s just how it was,” a voice in the crowd confirmed.
“He shouted, that’s true, he shouted three times,” another voice declared.
“Three times it was, we all heard it,” shouted a third.
But the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened. It was evident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person who was awaiting it somewhere; the police, of course, were in no little anxiety to avoid upsetting his arrangements. All they had to do was to take the injured man to the police station and the hospital. No one knew his name.
Meanwhile Raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped closer over him. The lantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate man’s face. He recognised him.
“I know him! I know him!” he shouted, pushing to the front. “It’s a government clerk retired from the service, Marmeladov. He lives close by in Kozel’s house.... Make haste for a doctor! I will pay, see?” He pulled money out of his pocket and showed it to the policeman. He was in violent agitation.
The police were glad that they had found out who the man was. Raskolnikov gave his own name and address, and, as earnestly as if it had been his father, he besought the police to carry the unconscious Marmeladov to his lodging at once.
“Just here, three houses away,” he said eagerly, “the house belongs to Kozel, a rich German. He was going home, no doubt drunk. I know him, he is a drunkard. He has a family there, a wife, children, he has one daughter.... It will take time to take him to the hospital, and there is sure to be a doctor in the house. I’ll pay, I’ll pay! At least he will be looked after at home... they will help him at once. But he’ll die before you get him to the hospital.” He managed to slip something unseen into the policeman’s hand. But the thing was straightforward and legitimate, and in any case help was closer here. They raised the injured man; people volunteered to help.
Kozel’s house was thirty yards away. Raskolnikov walked behind, carefully holding Marmeladov’s head and showing the way.
“This way, this way! We must take him upstairs head foremost. Turn round! I’ll pay, I’ll make it worth your while,” he muttered.
Katerina Ivanovna had just begun, as she always did at every free moment, walking to and fro in her little room from window to stove and back again, with her arms folded across her chest, talking to herself and coughing. Of late she had begun to talk more than ever to her eldest girl, Polenka, a child of ten, who, though there was much she did not understand, understood very well that her mother needed her, and so always watched her with her big clever eyes and strove her utmost to appear to understand. This time Polenka was undressing her little brother, who had been unwell all day and was going to bed. The boy was waiting for her to take off his shirt, which had to be washed at night. He was sitting straight and motionless on a chair, with a silent, serious face, with his legs stretched out straight before him—heels together and toes turned out.
He was listening to what his mother was saying to his sister, sitting perfectly still with pouting lips and wide-open eyes, just as all good little boys have to sit when they are undressed to go to bed. A little girl, still younger, dressed literally in rags, stood at the screen, waiting for her turn. The door on to the stairs was open to relieve them a little from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the other rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in the poor, consumptive woman. Katerina Ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinner during that week and the hectic flush on her face was brighter than ever.
“You wouldn’t believe, you can’t imagine, Polenka,” she said, walking about the room, “what a happy luxurious life we had in my papa’s house and how this drunkard has brought me, and will bring you all, to ruin! Papa was a civil colonel and only a step from being a governor; so that everyone who came to see him said, ‘We look upon you, Ivan Mihailovitch, as our governor!’ When I... when...” she coughed violently, “oh, cursed life,” she cried, clearing her throat and pressing her hands to her breast, “when I... when at the last ball... at the marshal’s... Princess Bezzemelny saw me—who gave me the blessing when your father and I were married, Polenka—she asked at once ‘Isn’t that the pretty girl who danced the shawl dance at the breaking-up?’ (You must mend that tear, you must take your needle and darn it as I showed you, or to-morrow—cough, cough, cough—he will make the hole bigger,” she articulated with effort.) “Prince Schegolskoy, a kammerjunker, had just come from Petersburg then... he danced the mazurka with me and wanted to make me an offer next day; but I thanked him in flattering expressions and told him that my heart had long been another’s. That other was your father, Polya; papa was fearfully angry.... Is the water ready? Give me the shirt, and the stockings! Lida,” said she to the youngest one, “you must manage without your chemise to-night... and lay your stockings out with it... I’ll wash them together.... How is it that drunken vagabond doesn’t come in? He has worn his shirt till it looks like a dish-clout, he has torn it to rags! I’d do it all together, so as not to have to work two nights running! Oh, dear! (Cough, cough, cough, cough!) Again! What’s this?” she cried, noticing a crowd in the passage and the men, who were pushing into her room, carrying a burden. “What is it? What are they bringing? Mercy on us!”",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"In this passage, an elegant carriage with spirited grey horses has caused a commotion in the streets due to an accident where a drunken man, identified as Marmeladov by Raskolnikov, has been run over and lies gravely injured. Despite the coachman's claims of having tried to avoid the accident, Marmeladov is in a critical state and bleeding heavily. Raskolnikov, recognizing Marmeladov as a retired government clerk who lives nearby, persuades the police to take him to his home instead of the hospital, promising to cover any expenses. Concurrently, Marmeladov's wife, Katerina Ivanovna, is depicted in her home lamenting their descent from a once prosperous life due to her husband's alcoholism, as she tends to their children in their impoverished conditions. The scene culminates with the arrival of the injured Marmeladov, carried into their home by the crowd.",1273
"The journey from Paris to Dresden at that time took five days and nights. On the German frontier, near Forbach, we met with stormy weather and snow, a greeting which seemed inhospitable after the spring we had already enjoyed in Paris. And, indeed, as we continued our journey through our native land once more, we found much to dishearten us, and I could not help thinking that the Frenchmen who on leaving Germany breathed more freely on reaching French soil, and unbuttoned their coats, as though passing from winter into summer, were not so very foolish after all, seeing that we, for our part, were now compelled to seek protection against this conspicuous change of temperature by being very careful to put on sufficient clothing. The unkindness of the elements became perfect torture when, later on, between Frankfort and Leipzig, we were swept into the stream of visitors to the Great Easter Fair.
The pressure on the mail-coaches was so great, that for two days and a night, amid ceaseless storm, snow and rain, we were continually changing from one wretched ‘substitute’ to another, thus turning our journey into an adventure of almost the same type as our former voyage at sea.
One solitary flash of brightness was afforded by our view of the Wartburg, which we passed during the only sunlit hour of this journey. The sight of this mountain fastness, which, from the Fulda side, is clearly visible for a long time, affected me deeply. A neighbouring ridge further on I at once christened the Horselberg, and as we drove through the valley, pictured to myself the scenery for the third act of my Tannhäuser. This scene remained so vividly in my mind, that long afterwards I was able to give Desplechin, the Parisian scene-painter, exact details when he was working out the scenery under my direction. If I had already been impressed by the significance of the fact that my first journey through the German Rhine district, so famous in legend, should have been made on my way home from Paris, it seemed an even more ominous coincidence that my first sight of Wartburg, which was so rich in historical and mythical associations, should come just at this moment. The view so warmed my heart against wind and weather, Jews and the Leipzig Fair, that in the end I arrived, on 12th April, 1842, safe and sound, with my poor, battered, half-frozen wife, in that selfsame city of Dresden which I had last seen on the occasion of my sad separation from my Minna, and my departure for my northern place of exile.
We put up at the ‘Stadt Gotha’ inn. The city, in which such momentous years of my childhood and boyhood had been spent, seemed cold and dead beneath the influences of the wild, gloomy weather. Indeed, everything there that could remind me of my youth seemed dead. No hospitable house received us. We found my wife’s parents living in cramped and dingy lodgings in very straitened circumstances, and were obliged at once to look about for a small abode for ourselves. This we found in the Topfergasse for twenty-one marks a month. After paying the necessary business visits in connection with Rienzi, and making arrangements for Minna during my brief absence, I set out on 15th April direct for Leipzig, where I saw my mother and family for the first time in six years.
During this period, which had been so eventful for my own life, my mother had undergone a great change in her domestic position through the death of Rosalie. She was living in a pleasant roomy flat near the Brockhaus family, where she was free from all those household cares to which, owing to her large family, she had devoted so many years of anxious thought. Her bustling energy, which had almost amounted to hardness, had entirely given place to a natural cheerfulness and interest in the family prosperity of her married daughters. For the blissful calm of this happy old age she was mainly indebted to the affectionate care of her son-in-law, Friedrich Brockhaus, to whom I expressed my heartfelt thanks for his goodness. She was exceedingly astonished and pleased to see me unexpectedly enter her room. Any bitterness that ever existed between us had utterly vanished, and her only complaint was that she could not put me up in her house, instead of my brother Julius, the unfortunate goldsmith, who had none of the qualities that could make him a suitable companion for her. She was full of hope for the success of my undertaking, and felt this confidence strengthened by the favourable prophecy which our dear Rosalie had made about me shortly before her sad death.
For the present, however, I only stayed a few days in Leipzig, as I had first to visit Berlin in order to make definite arrangements with Count Redern for the performance of the Fliegender Holländer. As I have already observed, I was here at once destined to learn that the Count was on the point of retiring from the directorship, and he accordingly referred me for all further decisions to the new director, Küstner, who had not yet arrived in Berlin. I now suddenly realised what this strange circumstance meant, and knew that, so far as the Berlin negotiations went, I might as well have remained in Paris. This impression was in the main confirmed by a visit to Meyerbeer, who, I found, regarded my coming to Berlin as over hasty. Nevertheless, he behaved in a kind and friendly manner, only regretting that he was just on the point of ‘going away,’ a state in which I always found him whenever I visited him again in Berlin.
Mendelssohn was also in the capital about this time, having been appointed one of the General Musical Directors to the King of Prussia. I also sought him out, having been previously introduced to him in Leipzig. He informed me that he did not believe his work would prosper in Berlin, and that he would rather go back to Leipzig. I made no inquiry about the fate of the score of my great symphony performed at Leipzig in earlier days, which I had more or less forced upon him so many years ago. On the other hand, he did not betray to me any signs of remembering that strange offering. In the midst of the lavish comforts of his home he struck me as cold, yet it was not so much that he repelled me as that I recoiled from him. I also paid a visit to Rellstab, to whom I had a letter of introduction from his trusty publisher, my brother-in-law Brockhaus.

"SUPPOSING that Truth is a woman—what then? Is there not ground for suspecting that all philosophers, in so far as they have been dogmatists, have failed to understand women—that the terrible seriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually paid their addresses to Truth, have been unskilled and unseemly methods for winning a woman? Certainly she has never allowed herself to be won; and at present every kind of dogma stands with sad and discouraged mien—IF, indeed, it stands at all! For there are scoffers who maintain that it has fallen, that all dogma lies on the ground—nay more, that it is at its last gasp. But to speak seriously, there are good grounds for hoping that all dogmatizing in philosophy, whatever solemn, whatever conclusive and decided airs it has assumed, may have been only a noble puerilism and tyronism; and probably the time is at hand when it will be once and again understood WHAT has actually sufficed for the basis of such imposing and absolute philosophical edifices as the dogmatists have hitherto reared: perhaps some popular superstition of immemorial time (such as the soul-superstition, which, in the form of subject- and ego-superstition, has not yet ceased doing mischief): perhaps some play upon words, a deception on the part of grammar, or an audacious generalization of very restricted, very personal, very human—all-too-human facts. The philosophy of the dogmatists, it is to be hoped, was only a promise for thousands of years afterwards, as was astrology in still earlier times, in the service of which probably more labour, gold, acuteness, and patience have been spent than on any actual science hitherto: we owe to it, and to its ""super-terrestrial"" pretensions in Asia and Egypt, the grand style of architecture. It seems that in order to inscribe themselves upon the heart of humanity with everlasting claims, all great things have first to wander about the earth as enormous and awe-inspiring caricatures: dogmatic philosophy has been a caricature of this kind—for instance, the Vedanta doctrine in Asia, and Platonism in Europe. Let us not be ungrateful to it, although it must certainly be confessed that the worst, the most tiresome, and the most dangerous of errors hitherto has been a dogmatist error—namely, Plato's invention of Pure Spirit and the Good in Itself. But now when it has been surmounted, when Europe, rid of this nightmare, can again draw breath freely and at least enjoy a healthier—sleep, we, WHOSE DUTY IS WAKEFULNESS ITSELF, are the heirs of all the strength which the struggle against this error has fostered. It amounted to the very inversion of truth, and the denial of the PERSPECTIVE—the fundamental condition—of life, to speak of Spirit and the Good as Plato spoke of them; indeed one might ask, as a physician: ""How did such a malady attack that finest product of antiquity, Plato? Had the wicked Socrates really corrupted him? Was Socrates after all a corrupter of youths, and deserved his hemlock?"" But the struggle against Plato, or—to speak plainer, and for the ""people""—the struggle against the ecclesiastical oppression of millenniums of Christianity (FOR CHRISTIANITY IS PLATONISM FOR THE ""PEOPLE""), produced in Europe a magnificent tension of soul, such as had not existed anywhere previously; with such a tensely strained bow one can now aim at the furthest goals. As a matter of fact, the European feels this tension as a state of distress, and twice attempts have been made in grand style to unbend the bow: once by means of Jesuitism, and the second time by means of democratic enlightenment—which, with the aid of liberty of the press and newspaper-reading, might, in fact, bring it about that the spirit would not so easily find itself in ""distress""! (The Germans invented gunpowder—all credit to them! but they again made things square—they invented printing.) But we, who are neither Jesuits, nor democrats, nor even sufficiently Germans, we GOOD EUROPEANS, and free, VERY free spirits—we have it still, all the distress of spirit and all the tension of its bow! And perhaps also the arrow, the duty, and, who knows? THE GOAL TO AIM AT....",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"The passage suggests that philosophers have historically approached Truth as one would approach a woman, but their methods have been clumsy and ineffective. Dogmatic philosophies, much like outdated practices such as astrology, have been based on popular superstitions and errors, particularly Platonic ideals like Pure Spirit and the Good in Itself. These dogmatic beliefs are now seen as distortions of truth that Europe has tried to overcome, resulting in a heightened intellectual tension. Attempts to alleviate this tension include Jesuitism and democratic enlightenment, but neither has fully succeeded. The passage concludes by identifying the current generation of free spirits, termed 'Good Europeans,' who inherit both the distress and the duty to seek truth, and perhaps, have a clear goal to aim for.",701

But to speak seriously, there are good grounds for hoping that all dogmatizing in philosophy, whatever solemn, whatever conclusive and decided airs it has assumed, may have been only a noble puerilism and tyronism; and probably the time is at hand when it will be once and again understood WHAT has actually sufficed for the basis of such imposing and absolute philosophical edifices as the dogmatists have hitherto reared: perhaps some popular superstition of immemorial time (such as the soul-superstition, which, in the form of subject- and ego-superstition, has not yet ceased doing mischief): perhaps some play upon words, a deception on the part of grammar, or an audacious generalization of very restricted, very personal, very human—all-too-human facts.

"SUPPOSING that Truth is a woman—what then?

"He lifts his hands. Veils fall. O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells aquiring.
—Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said. A most instructive discussion. Mr Mulligan, I’ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of Shakespeare. All sides of life should be represented.
He smiled on all sides equally.
Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled:
—Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.
A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.
—To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. The chap that writes like Synge.
Mr Best turned to him.
—Haines missed you, he said. Did you meet him? He’ll see you after at the D. B. C. He’s gone to Gill’s to buy Hyde’s Lovesongs of Connacht.
—I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. Was he here?
—The bard’s fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tired perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. I hear that an actress played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin. Vining held that the prince was a woman. Has no-one made him out to be an Irishman? Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues. He swears (His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.
—The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde’s, Mr Best said, lifting his brilliant notebook. That Portrait of Mr W. H. where he proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.
—For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.
Or Hughie Wills? Mr William Himself. W. H.: who am I?
—I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily. Of course it’s all paradox, don’t you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the colour, but it’s so typical the way he works it out. It’s the very essence of Wilde, don’t you know. The light touch.
His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe. Tame essence of Wilde.
You’re darned witty. Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasy’s ducats.
How much did I spend? O, a few shillings.
For a plump of pressmen. Humour wet and dry.
Wit. You would give your five wits for youth’s proud livery he pranks in. Lineaments of gratified desire.
There be many mo. Take her for me. In pairing time. Jove, a cool ruttime send them. Yea, turtledove her.
Eve. Naked wheatbellied sin. A snake coils her, fang in’s kiss.
—Do you think it is only a paradox? the quaker librarian was asking. The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.
They talked seriously of mocker’s seriousness.
Buck Mulligan’s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, his head wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. His mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.
—Telegram! he said. Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!
He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:
—The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done. Signed: Dedalus. Where did you launch it from? The kips? No. College Green. Have you drunk the four quid? The aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father. Telegram! Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street. O, you peerless mummer! O, you priestified Kinchite!
Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a querulous brogue:
—It’s what I’m telling you, mister honey, it’s queer and sick we were, Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in. ’Twas murmur we did for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I’m thinking, and he limp with leching. And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery’s sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.
He wailed:
—And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.
Stephen laughed.
Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.
—The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you. He heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. He’s out in pampooties to murder you.
—Me! Stephen exclaimed. That was your contribution to literature.
Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling.
—Murder you! he laughed.
Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of lights in rue Saint-André-des-Arts. In words of words for words, palabras. Oisin with Patrick. Faunman he met in Clamart woods, brandishing a winebottle. C’est vendredi saint! Murthering Irish. His image, wandering, he met. I mine. I met a fool i’the forest.
—Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.
—... in which everyone can find his own. So Mr Justice Madden in his Diary of Master William Silence has found the hunting terms... Yes? What is it?
—There’s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and offering a card. From the Freeman. He wants to see the files of the Kilkenny People for last year.
—Certainly, certainly, certainly. Is the gentleman?...
He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked, asked, creaked, asked:
—Is he?... O, there!
Brisk in a galliard he was off, out. In the daylit corridor he talked with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most honest broadbrim.
—This gentleman? Freeman’s Journal? Kilkenny People? To be sure. Good day, sir. Kilkenny... We have certainly...
A patient silhouette waited, listening.
—All the leading provincial... Northern Whig, Cork Examiner, Enniscorthy Guardian, 1903... Will you please?... Evans, conduct this gentleman... If you just follow the atten... Or, please allow me... This way... Please, sir...
Voluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing dark figure following his hasty heels.
The door closed.
—The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.
He jumped up and snatched the card.
—What’s his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom.
He rattled on:
—Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. I found him over in the museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. The Greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer. Every day we must do homage to her. Life of life, thy lips enkindle.
Suddenly he turned to Stephen:
—He knows you. He knows your old fellow. O, I fear me, he is Greeker than the Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove. Venus Kallipyge. O, the thunder of those loins! The god pursuing the maiden hid.
—We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best’s approval. We begin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had thought of her, if at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.
—Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus’ brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope. Twenty years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was rich.

The door closed.
—The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.
He jumped up and snatched the card.
—What’s his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom.
He rattled on:
—Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. I found him over in the museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. The Greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer. Every day we must do homage to her. Life of life, thy lips enkindle.
Suddenly he turned to Stephen:
—He knows you. He knows your old fellow. O, I fear me, he is Greeker than the Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove. Venus Kallipyge. O, the thunder of those loins! The god pursuing the maiden hid.
—We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best’s approval. We begin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had thought of her, if at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.
—Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus’ brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope. Twenty years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was rich. His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the art of surfeit. Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies. Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays. The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba. Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures. You know Manningham’s story of the burgher’s wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in Richard III and how Shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon’s blankets: William the conqueror came before Richard III. And the gay lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the punks of the bankside, a penny a time.",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"In this passage from James Joyce's 'Ulysses,' a group of intellectuals, including Buck Mulligan, Stephen Dedalus, and others, engage in a lively discussion about various subjects, mainly focusing on Shakespeare. They touch upon theories about Shakespeare's works, including Wilde’s theory of Willie Hughes, and the roles of characters like Hamlet. The banter includes references to drinking, telegrams, and literary figures. Mr Best mentions Haines, who is buying a book of Irish lovesongs. Buck Mulligan reads a humorous telegram aloud. The conversation shifts towards an attendant helping a visitor looking for newspaper files. Buck Mulligan also makes a sarcastic remark about the visitor, referencing Bloom. Stephen then narrates a brief history involving Shakespeare and other literary figures. The passage characterizes the group's dynamic, wit, and mockery while delving into scholarly interpretations and personal jests.",1359
"For the main plot we have no direct source. It represents, however, Jonson’s typical method. It has been pointed out([53]) that the characteristic Jonsonian comedy always consists of two groups, the intriguers and the victims. In The Devil is an Ass the most purely comic motive of the play is furnished by a reversal of the usual relation subsisting between these two groups. Here the devil, who was wont to be looked upon as arch-intriguer, is constantly ‘fooled off and beaten’, and thus takes his position as the comic butt. Pug, in a sense, represents a satirical trend. Through him Jonson satirizes the outgrown supernaturalism which still clung to the skirts [xlii]of Jacobean realism, and at the same time paints in lively colors the vice of a society against which hell itself is powerless to contend. It is only, however, in a general way, where the devil stands for a principle, that Pug may be considered as in any degree satirical. In the particular incident he is always a purely comic figure, and furnishes the mirth which results from a sense of the incongruity between anticipation and accomplishment.
Fitzdottrel, on the other hand, is mainly satirical. Through him Jonson passes censure upon the city gallant, the attendant at the theatre, the victim of the prevalent superstitions, and even the pretended demoniac. His dupery, as in the case of his bargain with Wittipol, excites indignation rather than mirth, and his final discomfiture affords us almost a sense of poetic justice. This character stands in the position of chief victim.
In an intermediate position are Merecraft and Everill. They succeed in swindling Fitzdottrel and Lady Tailbush, but are in turn played upon by the chief intriguer, Wittipol, with his friend Manly. Jonson’s moral purpose is here plainly visible, especially in contrast to Plautus, with whom the youthful intriguer is also the stock figure. The motive of the young man’s trickery in the Latin comedy is usually unworthy and selfish. That of Wittipol, on the other hand, is wholly disinterested, since he is represented as having already philosophically accepted the rejection of his advances at the hands of Mrs. Fitzdottrel.
In construction the play suffers from overabundance of material. Instead of a single main line of action, which is given clear precedence, there is rather a succession of elaborated episodes, carefully connected and motivated, but not properly subordinated. The plot is coherent and intricate rather than unified. This is further aggravated by the fact that the chief objects of satire are imperfectly understood by readers of the present day.
Jonson observes unity of time, Pug coming to earth in the morning and returning at midnight. With the exception [xliii]of the first scene, which is indeterminate, and seems at one moment to be hell, and the next London, the action is confined to the City, but hovers between Lincoln’s Inn, Newgate, and the house of Lady Tailbush. Unity of action is of course broken by the interference of the devil-plot and the episodic nature of the satirical plot. The main lines of action may be discussed separately.
In the first act chief prominence is given to the intrigue between Wittipol and Mrs. Fitzdottrel. This interest is continued through the second act, but practically dropped after this point. In Act 4 we find that both lovers have recovered from their infatuation, and the intrigue ends by mutual consent.
The second act opens with the episode of Merecraft’s plot to gull Fitzdottrel. The project of the dukedom of Drownedland is given chief place, and attention is centred upon it both here and in the following scenes. Little use, however, is made of it in the motivation of action. This is left for another project, the office of the Master of Dependencies (quarrels) in the next act. This device is introduced in an incidental way, and we are not prepared for the important place which it takes in the development of the plot. Merecraft, goaded by Everill, hits upon it merely as a temporary makeshift to extort money from Fitzdottrel. The latter determines to make use of the office in prosecuting his quarrel with Wittipol. In preparation for the duel, and in accordance with the course of procedure laid down by Everill, he resolves to settle his estate. Merecraft and Everill endeavor to have the deed drawn in their own favor, but through the interference of Wittipol the whole estate is made over to Manly, who restores it to Mrs. Fitzdottrel. This project becomes then the real turning-point of the play.
The episode of Guilthead and Plutarchus in Act 3 is only slightly connected with the main plot. That of Wittipol’s disguise as a Spanish lady, touched upon in the first two acts, becomes the chief [xliv]interest of the fourth. It furnishes much comic material, and the characters of Lady Tailbush and Lady Eitherside offer the poet the opportunity for some of his cleverest touches in characterization and contrast.([54]) The scene, however, is introduced for incidental purposes, the satirization of foreign fashions and the follies of London society, and is overelaborated. The catalogue of cosmetics is an instance of Jonson’s intimate acquaintance with recondite knowledge standing in the way of his art.
Merecraft’s ‘after game’ in the fifth act is of the nature of an appendix. The play might well have ended with the frustration of his plan to get possession of the estate. This act is introduced chiefly for the sake of a satire upon pretended demoniacs and witch-finders. It also contains the conclusion of the devil-plot.
The Devil is an Ass will always remain valuable as a historical document, and as a record of Jonson’s own attitude towards the abuses of his times. In the treatment of Fitzdottrel and Merecraft among the chief persons, and of Plutarchus Guilthead among the lesser, this play belongs to Jonson’s character-drama.([55]) It does not, however, belong to the pure humor-comedy. Like The Alchemist, and in marked contrast to Every Man out of his Humor, interest is sought in plot development. In the scene between Lady Tailbush and Lady Eitherside, the play becomes a comedy of manners, and in its attack upon state abuses it is semi-political in nature. Both Gifford and Swinburne have observed the ethical treatment of the main motives.
With the exception of Prologue and Epilogue, the doggerel couplets spoken by Iniquity, Wittipol’s song (2. 6. 94), and some of the lines quoted by Fitzdottrel in the last scene, the play is written in blank verse throughout. Occasional lines of eight (2. 2. 122), nine (2. 1. 1), [xlv]twelve (1. 1. 33) or thirteen (1. 1. 113) syllables are introduced. Most of these could easily be normalized by a slight emendation or the slurring of a syllable in pronunciation. Many of the lines, however, are rough and difficult of scansion. Most of the dialogue is vigorous, though Wittipol’s language is sometimes affected and unnatural (cf. Act 1. Sc. 1). His speech, 1. 6. 111-148, is classical in tone, but fragmentary and not perfectly assimilated. The song already referred to possesses delicacy and some beauty of imagery, but lacks Jonson’s customary polish and smoothness.
As a work of art the play must rely chiefly upon the vigor of its satiric dialogue and the cleverness of its character sketches. It lacks the chief excellences of construction—unity of interest, subordination of detail, steady and uninterrupted development, and prompt conclusion.",,,GPT-4o,当代文学,英文,"The passage provides an analysis of Ben Jonson's play 'The Devil is an Ass,' highlighting its deviation from Jonson's typical comedy structure.

"My God, how it has all ended! What it has all ended in! I arrived at nine o'clock. She was already there. I noticed her a good way off; she was standing as she had been that first time, with her elbows on the railing, and she did not hear me coming up to her.
""Nastenka!"" I called to her, suppressing my agitation with an effort.
She turned to me quickly.
""Well?"" she said. ""Well? Make haste!""
I looked at her in perplexity.
""Well, where is the letter? Have you brought the letter?"" she repeated clutching at the railing.
""No, there is no letter,"" I said at last. ""Hasn't he been to you yet?"" She turned fearfully pale and looked at me for a long time without moving. I had shattered her last hope.
""Well, God be with him,"" she said at last in a breaking voice; ""God be with him if he leaves me like that.""
She dropped her eyes, then tried to look at me and could not. For several minutes she was struggling with her emotion. All at once she turned away, leaning her elbows against the railing and burst into tears.
""Oh don't, don't!"" I began; but looking at her I had not the heart to go on, and what was I to say to her?
""Don't try and comfort me,"" she said; ""don't talk about him; don't tell me that he will come, that he has not cast me off so cruelly and so inhumanly as he has. What for—what for? Can there have been something in my letter, that unlucky letter?""
At that point sobs stifled her voice; my heart was torn as I looked at her.
""Oh, how inhumanly cruel it is!"" she began again. ""And not a line, not a line! He might at least have written that he does not want me, that he rejects me—but not a line for three days! How easy it is for him to wound, to insult a poor, defenceless girl, whose only fault is that she loves him! Oh, what I've suffered during these three days! Oh, dear! When I think that I was the first to go to him, that I humbled myself before him, cried, that I begged of him a little love!... and after that! Listen,"" she said, turning to me, and her black eyes flashed, ""it isn't so! It can't be so; it isn't natural. Either you are mistaken or I; perhaps he has not received the letter? Perhaps he still knows nothing about it? How could any one—judge for yourself, tell me, for goodness' sake explain it to me, I can't understand it—how could any one behave with such barbarous coarseness as he has behaved to me? Not one word! Why, the lowest creature on earth is treated more compassionately. Perhaps he has heard something, perhaps some one has told him something about me,"" she cried, turning to me inquiringly: ""What do you think?""
""Listen, Nastenka, I shall go to him to-morrow in your name.""
""Yes?""
""I will question him about everything; I will tell him everything.""
""Yes, yes?""
""You write a letter. Don't say no, Nastenka, don't say no! I will make him respect your action, he shall hear all about it, and if——""
""No, my friend, no,"" she interrupted. ""Enough! Not another word, not another line from me—enough! I don't know him; I don't love him any more. I will ... forget him.""
She could not go on.
""Calm yourself, calm yourself! Sit here, Nastenka,"" I said, making her sit down on the seat.
""I am calm. Don't trouble. It's nothing! It's only tears, they will soon dry. Why, do you imagine I shall do away with myself, that I shall throw myself into the river?""
My heart was full: I tried to speak, but I could not.
""Listen,"" she said taking my hand. ""Tell me: you wouldn't have behaved like this, would you? You would not have abandoned a girl who had come to you of herself, you would not have thrown into her face a shameless taunt at her weak foolish heart? You would have taken care of her? You would have realized that she was alone, that she did not know how to look after herself, that she could not guard herself from loving you, that it was not her fault, not her fault—that she had done nothing.... Oh dear, oh dear!""
""Nastenka!"" I cried at last, unable to control my emotion. ""Nastenka, you torture me! You wound my heart, you are killing me, Nastenka! I cannot be silent! I must speak at last, give utterance to what is surging in my heart!""
As I said this I got up from the seat. She took my hand and looked at me in surprise.
""What is the matter with you?"" she said at last.

""It's impossible, but I love you, Nastenka! There it is! Now everything is told,"" I said with a wave of my hand. ""Now you will see whether you can go on talking to me as you did just now, whether you can listen to what I am going to say to you.""...

""What's to be done, Nastenka, what am I to do? I am to blame. I have abused your.... But no, no, I am not to blame, Nastenka; I feel that, I know that, because my heart tells me I am right, for I cannot hurt you in any way, I cannot wound you! I was your friend, but I am still your friend, I have betrayed no trust. Here my tears are falling, Nastenka. Let them flow, let them flow—they don't hurt anybody. They will dry, Nastenka.""

"My God, how it has all ended! What it has all ended in! I arrived at nine o'clock. She was already there. I noticed her a good way off; she was standing as she had been that first time, with her elbows on the railing, and she did not hear me coming up to her.
""Nastenka!"" I called to her, suppressing my agitation with an effort.
She turned to me quickly.
""Well?"" she said. ""Well? Make haste!""
I looked at her in perplexity.
""Well, where is the letter? Have you brought the letter?"" she repeated clutching at the railing.
""No, there is no letter,"" I said at last. ""Hasn't he been to you yet?"" She turned fearfully pale and looked at me for a long time without moving. I had shattered her last hope.
""Well, God be with him,"" she said at last in a breaking voice; ""God be with him if he leaves me like that.""
She dropped her eyes, then tried to look at me and could not. For several minutes she was struggling with her emotion. All at once she turned away, leaning her elbows against the railing and burst into tears.
""Oh don't, don't!"" I began; but looking at her I had not the heart to go on, and what was I to say to her?
""Don't try and comfort me,"" she said; ""don't talk about him; don't tell me that he will come, that he has not cast me off so cruelly and so inhumanly as he has. What for—what for? Can there have been something in my letter, that unlucky letter?""
At that point sobs stifled her voice; my heart was torn as I looked at her.
""Oh, how inhumanly cruel it is!"" she began again. ""And not a line, not a line! He might at least have written that he does not want me, that he rejects me—but not a line for three days! How easy it is for him to wound, to insult a poor, defenceless girl, whose only fault is that she loves him! Oh, what I've suffered during these three days! Oh, dear! When I think that I was the first to go to him, that I humbled myself before him, cried, that I begged of him a little love!... and after that! Listen,"" she said, turning to me, and her black eyes flashed, ""it isn't so! It can't be so; it isn't natural. Either you are mistaken or I; perhaps he has not received the letter? Perhaps he still knows nothing about it? How could any one—judge for yourself, tell me, for goodness' sake explain it to me, I can't understand it—how could any one behave with such barbarous coarseness as he has behaved to me? Not one word! Why, the lowest creature on earth is treated more compassionately. Perhaps he has heard something, perhaps some one has told him something about me,"" she cried, turning to me inquiringly: ""What do you think?""
""Listen, Nastenka, I shall go to him to-morrow in your name.""
""Yes?""
""I will question him about everything; I will tell him everything.""
""Yes, yes?""
""You write a letter. Don't say no, Nastenka, don't say no! I will make him respect your action, he shall hear all about it, and if——""
""No, my friend, no,"" she interrupted. ""Enough! Not another word, not another line from me—enough! I don't know him; I don't love him any more. I will ... forget him.""
She could not go on.
""Calm yourself, calm yourself! Sit here, Nastenka,"" I said, making her sit down on the seat.
""I am calm. Don't trouble. It's nothing! It's only tears, they will soon dry. Why, do you imagine I shall do away with myself, that I shall throw myself into the river?""
My heart was full: I tried to speak, but I could not.
""Listen,"" she said taking my hand. ""Tell me: you wouldn't have behaved like this, would you? You would not have abandoned a girl who had come to you of herself, you would not have thrown into her face a shameless taunt at her weak foolish heart? You would have taken care of her? You would have realized that she was alone, that she did not know how to look after herself, that she could not guard herself from loving you, that it was not her fault, not her fault—that she had done nothing.... Oh dear, oh dear!""
""Nastenka!"" I cried at last, unable to control my emotion. ""Nastenka, you torture me! You wound my heart, you are killing me, Nastenka! I cannot be silent! I must speak at last, give utterance to what is surging in my heart!""
As I said this I got up from the seat. She took my hand and looked at me in surprise.
""What is the matter with you?"" she said at last.
""Listen,"" I said resolutely. ""Listen to me, Nastenka! What I am going to say to you now is all nonsense, all impossible, all stupid! I know that this can never be, but I cannot be silent. For the sake of what you are suffering now, I beg you beforehand to forgive me!""

故不登高山，不知天之高也；不临深溪，不知地之厚也；不闻先王之遗言，不知学问之大也。干、越、夷、貉之子，生而同声，长而异俗，教使之然也。诗曰：“嗟尔君子，无恒安息。靖共尔位，好是正直。神之听之，介尔景福。”神莫大于化道，福莫长于无祸。

"君子曰：学不可以已。
青，取之于蓝，而青于蓝；冰，水为之，而寒于水。木直中绳，輮以为轮，其曲中规。虽有槁暴，不复挺者，輮使之然也。故木受绳则直，金就砺则利，君子博学而日参省乎己，则知明而行无过矣。
故不登高山，不知天之高也；不临深溪，不知地之厚也；不闻先王之遗言，不知学问之大也。干、越、夷、貉之子，生而同声，长而异俗，教使之然也。诗曰：“嗟尔君子，无恒安息。靖共尔位，好是正直。神之听之，介尔景福。”神莫大于化道，福莫长于无祸。
吾尝终日而思矣，不如须臾之所学也；吾尝跂而望矣，不如登高之博见也。登高而招，臂非加长也，而见者远；顺风而呼，声非加疾也，而闻者彰。假舆马者，非利足也，而致千里；假舟楫者，非能水也，而绝江河。君子生非异也，善假于物也。(君子生 通：性)
南方有鸟焉，名曰蒙鸠，以羽为巢，而编之以发，系之苇苕，风至苕折，卵破子死。巢非不完也，所系者然也。西方有木焉，名曰射干，茎长四寸，生于高山之上，而临百仞之渊，木茎非能长也，所立者然也。蓬生麻中，不扶而直；白沙在涅，与之俱黑。兰槐之根是为芷，其渐之滫，君子不近，庶人不服。其质非不美也，所渐者然也。故君子居必择乡，游必就士，所以防邪辟而近中正也。
物类之起，必有所始。荣辱之来，必象其德。肉腐出虫，鱼枯生蠹。怠慢忘身，祸灾乃作。强自取柱，柔自取束。邪秽在身，怨之所构。施薪若一，火就燥也，平地若一，水就湿也。草木畴生，禽兽群焉，物各从其类也。是故质的张，而弓矢至焉；林木茂，而斧斤至焉；树成荫，而众鸟息焉。醯酸，而蜹聚焉。故言有招祸也，行有招辱也，君子慎其所立乎！
积土成山，风雨兴焉；积水成渊，蛟龙生焉；积善成德，而神明自得，圣心备焉。故不积跬步，无以至千里；不积小流，无以成江海。骐骥一跃，不能十步；驽马十驾，功在不舍。锲而舍之，朽木不折；锲而不舍，金石可镂。蚓无爪牙之利，筋骨之强，上食埃土，下饮黄泉，用心一也。蟹六跪而二螯，非蛇鳝之穴无可寄托者，用心躁也。(江海 一作：江河)
是故无冥冥之志者，无昭昭之明；无惛惛之事者，无赫赫之功。行衢道者不至，事两君者不容。目不能两视而明，耳不能两听而聪。螣蛇无足而飞，鼫鼠五技而穷。《诗》曰：“尸鸠在桑，其子七兮。淑人君子，其仪一兮。其仪一兮，心如结兮！”故君子结于一也。
昔者瓠巴鼓瑟，而流鱼出听；伯牙鼓琴，而六马仰秣。故声无小而不闻，行无隐而不形 。玉在山而草木润，渊生珠而崖不枯。为善不积邪？安有不闻者乎？
学恶乎始？恶乎终？曰：其数则始乎诵经，终乎读礼；其义则始乎为士，终乎为圣人， 真积力久则入，学至乎没而后止也。故学数有终，若其义则不可须臾舍也。为之，人也；舍 之，禽兽也。故书者，政事之纪也；诗者，中声之所止也；礼者，法之大分，类之纲纪也。 故学至乎礼而止矣。夫是之谓道德之极。礼之敬文也，乐之中和也，诗书之博也，春秋之微 也，在天地之间者毕矣。

余情悦其淑美兮，心振荡而不怡。无良媒以接欢兮，托微波而通辞。愿诚素之先达兮，解玉佩以要之。嗟佳人之信修兮，羌习礼而明诗。抗琼珶以和予兮，指潜渊而为期。执眷眷之款实兮，惧斯灵之我欺。感交甫之弃言兮，怅犹豫而狐疑。收和颜而静志兮，申礼防以自持。
于是洛灵感焉，徙倚彷徨。神光离合，乍阴乍阳。竦轻躯以鹤立，若将飞而未翔。践椒涂之郁烈，步蘅薄而流芳。超长吟以永慕兮，声哀厉而弥长。尔乃众灵杂沓，命俦啸侣。或戏清流，或翔神渚，或采明珠，或拾翠羽。从南湘之二妃，携汉滨之游女。叹匏瓜之无匹兮，咏牵牛之独处。扬轻袿之猗靡兮，翳修袖以延伫。体迅飞凫，飘忽若神。凌波微步，罗袜生尘。动无常则，若危若安；进止难期，若往若还。转眄流精，光润玉颜。含辞未吐，气若幽兰。华容婀娜，令我忘餐。

孝公既没，惠文、武、昭襄蒙故业，因遗策，南取汉中，西举巴蜀，东割膏腴之地，北收要害之郡。诸侯恐惧，会盟而谋弱秦，不爱珍器重宝肥饶之地，以致天下之士，合从缔交，相与为一。当此之时，齐有孟尝，赵有平原，楚有春申，魏有信陵。此四君者，皆明智而忠信，宽厚而爱人，尊贤而重士，约从离衡，兼韩、魏、燕、楚、齐、赵、宋、卫、中山之众。于是六国之士，有甯越、徐尚、苏秦、杜赫之属为之谋，齐明、周最、陈轸、召滑、楼缓、翟景、苏厉、乐毅之徒通其意，吴起、孙膑、带佗、倪良、王廖、田忌、廉颇、赵奢之伦制其兵。尝以十倍之地，百万之众，叩关而攻秦。秦人开关延敌，九国之师，逡巡而不敢进。秦无亡矢遗镞之费，而天下诸侯已困矣。于是从散约败，争割地而赂秦。秦有余力而制其弊，追亡逐北，伏尸百万，流血漂橹。因利乘便，宰割天下，分裂山河。强国请服，弱国入朝。延及孝文王、庄襄王，享国之日浅，国家无事。

及至始皇，奋六世之余烈，振长策而御宇内，吞二周而亡诸侯，履至尊而制六合，执敲扑而鞭笞天下，威振四海。南取百越之地，以为桂林、象郡；百越之君，俯首系颈，委命下吏。乃使蒙恬北筑长城而守藩篱，却匈奴七百余里。胡人不敢南下而牧马，士不敢弯弓而报怨。于是废先王之道，焚百家之言，以愚黔首；隳名城，杀豪杰，收天下之兵，聚之咸阳，销锋镝，铸以为金人十二，以弱天下之民。然后践华为城，因河为池，据亿丈之城，临不测之渊，以为固。良将劲弩守要害之处，信臣精卒陈利兵而谁何。天下已定，始皇之心，自以为关中之固，金城千里，子孙帝王万世之业也。

始皇既没，余威震于殊俗。然陈涉瓮牖绳枢之子，氓隶之人，而迁徙之徒也；才能不及中人，非有仲尼、墨翟之贤，陶朱、猗顿之富；蹑足行伍之间，而倔起阡陌之中，率疲弊之卒，将数百之众，转而攻秦，斩木为兵，揭竿为旗，天下云集响应，赢粮而景从。山东豪俊遂并起而亡秦族矣。

且夫天下非小弱也，雍州之地，崤函之固，自若也。陈涉之位，非尊于齐、楚、燕、赵、韩、魏、宋、卫、中山之君也；锄櫌棘矜，非铦于钩戟长铩也；谪戍之众，非抗于九国之师也；深谋远虑，行军用兵之道，非及乡时之士也。然而成败异变，功业相反，何也？试使山东之国与陈涉度长絜大，比权量力，则不可同年而语矣。然秦以区区之地，致万乘之势，序八州而朝同列，百有余年矣；然后以六合为家，崤函为宫；一夫作难而七庙隳，身死人手，为天下笑者，何也？仁义不施而攻守之势异也。",,,GPT-4o,古文学,中文,这段文字概述了战国时期秦国从崛起到灭亡的历史进程。从秦孝公建立强大国力开始，通过商鞅变法和战争扩展疆域，逐步成为强大的国家。秦始皇统一六国后，采取焚书坑儒、收兵聚武等措施以巩固统治。然而，秦始皇死后，陈涉等起义，迅速导致秦朝灭亡。作者分析了秦国虽曾强大，但因仁义不施导致统治最终崩溃的原因。,1009

于是张良至军门见樊哙。樊哙曰：“今日之事何如？”良曰：“甚急！今者项庄拔剑舞，其意常在沛公也。”哙曰：“此迫矣！臣请入，与之同命。”哙即带剑拥盾入军门。交戟之卫士欲止不内，樊哙侧其盾以撞，卫士仆地，哙遂入，披帷西向立，瞋目视项王，头发上指，目眦尽裂。项王按剑而跽曰：“客何为者？”张良曰：“沛公之参乘樊哙者也。”项王曰：“壮士！赐之卮酒。”则与斗卮酒。哙拜谢，起，立而饮之。项王曰：“赐之彘肩。”则与一生彘肩。樊哙覆其盾于地，加彘肩上，拔剑切而啖之。项王曰：“壮士！能复饮乎？”樊哙曰：“臣死且不避，卮酒安足辞！夫秦王有虎狼之心，杀人如不能举，刑人如恐不胜，天下皆叛之。怀王与诸将约曰：‘先破秦入咸阳者王之。’今沛公先破秦入咸阳，毫毛不敢有所近，封闭宫室，还军霸上，以待大王来。故遣将守关者，备他盗出入与非常也。劳苦而功高如此，未有封侯之赏，而听细说，欲诛有功之人，此亡秦之续耳。窃为大王不取也！”项王未有以应，曰：“坐。”樊哙从良坐。坐须臾，沛公起如厕，因招樊哙出。",,,GPT-4o,古文学,中文,这段文字讲述了楚汉战争中的鸿门宴事件：项羽得知沛公意图称王关中后非常愤怒，范增建议迅速击杀沛公。项伯夜访沛公军营，告知张良并建议沛公前去向项羽谢罪。沛公与项羽见面时，项庄借剑舞之机试图刺杀沛公，但被项伯阻止。樊哙勇敢应对，表示沛公无意反叛，最终项羽并未采取行动，沛公成功逃脱险境。,1483

盖闻：人生在世，富贵不能淫，贫贱不能移。文章盖世，孔子厄于陈邦；武略超群，太公钓于渭水。颜渊命短，殊非凶恶之徒；盗跖年长，岂是善良之辈。尧帝明圣，却生不肖之儿；瞽叟愚顽，反生大孝之子。张良原是布衣，萧何曾为县吏。晏子身无五尺，封作齐国宰相；孔明卧居草庐，能作蜀汉军师。楚霸虽雄，败于乌江自刎；汉王虽弱，竟有万里江山。李广有射虎之威，到老无封；冯唐有乘龙之才，一生不遇。韩信未遇之时，无一日三餐，及至遇行，腰悬三尺玉印，一旦时衰，死于阴人之手。

有先贫而后富，有老壮而少衰。满腹文章，白发竟然不中；才疏学浅，少年及第登科。深院宫娥，运退反为妓妾；风流妓女，时来配作夫人。

秦嘉等闻陈王军破出走，乃立景驹为楚王，引兵之方与，欲击秦军定陶下。使公孙庆使齐王，欲与并力俱进。齐王曰：“闻陈王战败，不知其死生，楚安得不请而立王！”公孙庆曰：“齐不请楚而立王，楚何故请齐而立王！且楚首事，当令于天下。”田儋诛杀公孙庆。

"壬戌之秋，七月既望，苏子与客泛舟游于赤壁之下。清风徐来，水波不兴。举酒属客，诵明月之诗，歌窈窕之章。少焉，月出于东山之上，徘徊于斗牛之间。白露横江，水光接天。纵一苇之所如，凌万顷之茫然。浩浩乎如冯虚御风，而不知其所止；飘飘乎如遗世独立，羽化而登仙。(冯 通：凭)
于是饮酒乐甚，扣舷而歌之。歌曰：“桂棹兮兰桨，击空明兮溯流光。渺渺兮予怀，望美人兮天一方。”客有吹洞箫者，倚歌而和之。其声呜呜然，如怨如慕，如泣如诉；余音袅袅，不绝如缕。舞幽壑之潜蛟，泣孤舟之嫠妇。
苏子愀然，正襟危坐而问客曰：“何为其然也？”客曰：“‘月明星稀，乌鹊南飞’，此非曹孟德之诗乎？西望夏口，东望武昌，山川相缪，郁乎苍苍，此非孟德之困于周郎者乎？方其破荆州，下江陵，顺流而东也，舳舻千里，旌旗蔽空，酾酒临江，横槊赋诗，固一世之雄也，而今安在哉？况吾与子渔樵于江渚之上，侣鱼虾而友麋鹿，驾一叶之扁舟，举匏樽以相属。寄蜉蝣于天地，渺沧海之一粟。哀吾生之须臾，羡长江之无穷。挟飞仙以遨游，抱明月而长终。知不可乎骤得，托遗响于悲风。”
苏子曰：“客亦知夫水与月乎？逝者如斯，而未尝往也；盈虚者如彼，而卒莫消长也。盖将自其变者而观之，则天地曾不能以一瞬；自其不变者而观之，则物与我皆无尽也，而又何羡乎！且夫天地之间，物各有主，苟非吾之所有，虽一毫而莫取。惟江上之清风，与山间之明月，耳得之而为声，目遇之而成色，取之无禁，用之不竭。是造物者之无尽藏也，而吾与子之所共适。”(共适 一作：共食)

呜呼！其信然邪？其梦邪？其传之非其真邪？信也，吾兄之盛德而夭其嗣乎？汝之纯明而不克蒙其泽乎？少者强者而夭殁，长者衰者而存全乎？未可以为信也！梦也，传之非其真也，东野之书，耿兰之报，何为而在吾侧也？呜呼！其信然矣！吾兄之盛德而夭其嗣矣，汝之纯明宜业其家者，不克蒙其泽矣。所谓天者诚难测，而神者诚难明矣。所谓理者不可推，而寿者不可知矣。
虽然，吾自今年来，苍苍者或化而为白矣；动摇者或脱而落矣，毛血日益衰，志气日益微，几何不从汝而死也？死而有知，其几何离？其无知，悲不几时，而不悲者无穷期矣。
汝之子始十岁，吾之子始五岁，少而强者不可保，如此孩提者，又可冀其成立邪？呜呼哀哉！呜呼哀哉！
汝去年书云：“比得软脚病，往往而剧。”吾曰：“是疾也，江南之人，常常有之。”未始以为忧也。呜呼， 其竟以此而殒其生乎？抑别有疾而至斯极乎？
汝之书，六月十七日也；东野云，汝殁以六月二日；耿兰之报无月日。盖东野之使者不知问家人以月日，如耿兰之报，不知当言月日。东野与吾书，乃问使者，使者妄称以应之乎。其然乎？其不然乎？
今吾使建中祭汝，吊汝之孤与汝之乳母。彼有食可守，以待终丧，则待终丧而取以来；如不能守以终丧，则遂取以来。其余奴婢，并令守汝丧。吾力能改葬，终葬汝于先人之兆，然后惟其所愿。
呜呼！汝病吾不知时，汝殁吾不知日，生不能相养以共居，殁不能抚汝以尽哀，敛不凭其棺，窆不临其穴。吾行负神明，而使汝夭。不孝不慈，而不得与汝相养以生，相守以死。一在天之涯，一在地之角，生而影不与吾形相依，死而魂不与吾梦相接，吾实为之，其又何尤！彼苍者天，曷其有极！自今已往，吾其无意于人世矣！当求数顷之田于伊、颍之上，以待余年。教吾子与汝子，幸其成；长吾女与汝女，待其嫁，如此而已。
呜呼，言有穷而情不可终，汝其知也邪？其不知也邪？呜呼哀哉！尚飨！",,,GPT-4o,古文学,中文,这段文字描述了一位作者（可能是韩愈）在得知其侄子（十二郎）死亡后，怀着悲痛和愧疚之情写给侄子的祭文。作者回顾了自己和十二郎的共同经历，讲述了自己在少年丧父、依靠兄嫂、兄长早逝、与侄子一同生活的艰难岁月。随后，作者提及自己在外求仕，而与侄子分离的情况，并表达了对未能在侄子病故时尽孝尽责的痛苦与悔恨。最终，作者决定照顾好两人的后代，并计划在伊、颍之上安度余生。全文充满了对逝者的深切哀悼和对未来生活的隐忧。,1277

"汉末建安中，庐江府小吏焦仲卿妻刘氏，为仲卿母所遣，自誓不嫁。其家逼之，乃投水而死。仲卿闻之，亦自缢于庭树。时人伤之，为诗云尔。
孔雀东南飞，五里一徘徊。
“十三能织素，十四学裁衣。十五弹箜篌，十六诵诗书。十七为君妇，心中常苦悲。君既为府吏，守节情不移。贱妾留空房，相见常日稀。鸡鸣入机织，夜夜不得息。三日断五匹，大人故嫌迟。非为织作迟，君家妇难为！妾不堪驱使，徒留无所施。便可白公姥，及时相遣归。”
府吏得闻之，堂上启阿母：“儿已薄禄相，幸复得此妇。结发同枕席，黄泉共为友。共事二三年，始尔未为久。女行无偏斜，何意致不厚。”
阿母谓府吏：“何乃太区区！此妇无礼节，举动自专由。吾意久怀忿，汝岂得自由！东家有贤女，自名秦罗敷。可怜体无比，阿母为汝求。便可速遣之，遣去慎莫留！”
府吏长跪告：“伏惟启阿母。今若遣此妇，终老不复取！”
阿母得闻之，槌床便大怒：“小子无所畏，何敢助妇语！吾已失恩义，会不相从许！”
府吏默无声，再拜还入户。举言谓新妇，哽咽不能语：“我自不驱卿，逼迫有阿母。卿但暂还家，吾今且报府。不久当归还，还必相迎取。以此下心意，慎勿违吾语。”
新妇谓府吏：“勿复重纷纭。往昔初阳岁，谢家来贵门。奉事循公姥，进止敢自专？昼夜勤作息，伶俜萦苦辛。谓言无罪过，供养卒大恩；仍更被驱遣，何言复来还！妾有绣腰襦，葳蕤自生光；红罗复斗帐，四角垂香囊；箱帘六七十，绿碧青丝绳，物物各自异，种种在其中。人贱物亦鄙，不足迎后人，留待作遗施，于今无会因。时时为安慰，久久莫相忘！”
鸡鸣外欲曙，新妇起严妆。著我绣夹裙，事事四五通。足下蹑丝履，头上玳瑁光。腰若流纨素，耳著明月珰。指如削葱根，口如含朱丹。纤纤作细步，精妙世无双。
上堂拜阿母，阿母怒不止。“昔作女儿时，生小出野里。本自无教训，兼愧贵家子。受母钱帛多，不堪母驱使。今日还家去，念母劳家里。”却与小姑别，泪落连珠子。“新妇初来时，小姑始扶床；今日被驱遣，小姑如我长。勤心养公姥，好自相扶将。初七及下九，嬉戏莫相忘。”出门登车去，涕落百余行。
府吏马在前，新妇车在后。隐隐何甸甸，俱会大道口。下马入车中，低头共耳语：“誓不相隔卿，且暂还家去。吾今且赴府，不久当还归。誓天不相负！”
新妇谓府吏：“感君区区怀！君既若见录，不久望君来。君当作磐石，妾当作蒲苇。蒲苇纫如丝，磐石无转移。我有亲父兄，性行暴如雷，恐不任我意，逆以煎我怀。”举手长劳劳，二情同依依 。
入门上家堂，进退无颜仪。阿母大拊掌，不图子自归：“十三教汝织，十四能裁衣，十五弹箜篌，十六知礼仪，十七遣汝嫁，谓言无誓违。汝今何罪过，不迎而自归？”兰芝惭阿母：“儿实无罪过。”阿母大悲摧。
还家十余日，县令遣媒来。云有第三郎，窈窕世无双。年始十八九，便言多令才。
阿母谓阿女：“汝可去应之。”
阿女含泪答：“兰芝初还时，府吏见丁宁，结誓不别离。今日违情义，恐此事非奇。自可断来信，徐徐更谓之。”
阿母白媒人：“贫贱有此女，始适还家门。不堪吏人妇，岂合令郎君？幸可广问讯，不得便相许。”
媒人去数日，寻遣丞请还，说有兰家女，承籍有宦官。云有第五郎，娇逸未有婚。遣丞为媒人，主簿通语言。直说太守家，有此令郎君，既欲结大义，故遣来贵门。
阿母谢媒人：“女子先有誓，老姥岂敢言！”
阿兄得闻之，怅然心中烦。举言谓阿妹：“作计何不量！先嫁得府吏，后嫁得郎君。否泰如天地，足以荣汝身。不嫁义郎体，其往欲何云？”
兰芝仰头答：“理实如兄言。谢家事夫婿，中道还兄门。处分适兄意，那得自任专！虽与府吏要，渠会永无缘。登即相许和，便可作婚姻。”媒人下床去。诺诺复尔尔。还部白府君：“下官奉使命，言谈大有缘。”府君得闻之，心中大欢喜。视历复开书，便利此月内，六合正相应。良吉三十日，今已二十七，卿可去成婚。交语速装束，络绎如浮云。青雀白鹄舫，四角龙子幡。婀娜随风转，金车玉作轮。踯躅青骢马，流苏金镂鞍。赍钱三百万，皆用青丝穿。杂彩三百匹，交广市鲑珍。从人四五百，郁郁登郡门。
阿母谓阿女：“适得府君书，明日来迎汝。何不作衣裳？莫令事不举！”
阿女默无声，手巾掩口啼，泪落便如泻。移我琉璃榻，出置前窗下。左手持刀尺，右手执绫罗。朝成绣夹裙，晚成单罗衫。晻晻日欲暝，愁思出门啼。
府吏闻此变，因求假暂归。未至二三里，摧藏马悲哀。新妇识马声，蹑履相逢迎。怅然遥相望，知是故人来。举手拍马鞍，嗟叹使心伤：“自君别我后，人事不可量。果不如先愿，又非君所详。我有亲父母，逼迫兼弟兄。以我应他人，君还何所望！”
府吏谓新妇：“贺卿得高迁！磐石方且厚，可以卒千年；蒲苇一时纫，便作旦夕间。卿当日胜贵，吾独向黄泉！”
新妇谓府吏：“何意出此言！同是被逼迫，君尔妾亦然。黄泉下相见，勿违今日言！”执手分道去，各各还家门。生人作死别，恨恨那可论？念与世间辞，千万不复全！
府吏还家去，上堂拜阿母：“今日大风寒，寒风摧树木，严霜结庭兰。儿今日冥冥，令母在后单。故作不良计，勿复怨鬼神！命如南山石，四体康且直！”
阿母得闻之，零泪应声落：“汝是大家子，仕宦于台阁。慎勿为妇死，贵贱情何薄！东家有贤女，窈窕艳城郭，阿母为汝求，便复在旦夕。”
府吏再拜还，长叹空房中，作计乃尔立。转头向户里，渐见愁煎迫。
其日牛马嘶，新妇入青庐。奄奄黄昏后，寂寂人定初。“我命绝今日，魂去尸长留！”揽裙脱丝履，举身赴清池。
府吏闻此事，心知长别离。徘徊庭树下，自挂东南枝。
两家求合葬，合葬华山傍。东西植松柏，左右种梧桐。枝枝相覆盖，叶叶相交通。中有双飞鸟，自名为鸳鸯。仰头相向鸣，夜夜达五更。行人驻足听，寡妇起彷徨。多谢后世人，戒之慎勿忘。",,,GPT-4o,古文学,中文,这段文字出自《孔雀东南飞》，讲述了东汉末年庐江府小吏焦仲卿和妻子刘兰芝之间的爱情悲剧。因仲卿母亲不满兰芝的行为，坚持要遣走兰芝，导致夫妻二人被迫分离。兰芝被迫返回娘家后，家人强逼她改嫁他人，但兰芝与仲卿相爱至深，誓不再嫁，最终投水自尽。仲卿得知兰芝的死讯，悲痛欲绝，自缢于庭树。两人死后合葬，象征着他们深厚的爱情故事。,2256

其日牛马嘶，新妇入青庐。奄奄黄昏后，寂寂人定初。“我命绝今日，魂去尸长留！”揽裙脱丝履，举身赴清池。
府吏闻此事，心知长别离。徘徊庭树下，自挂东南枝。
两家求合葬，合葬华山傍。东西植松柏，左右种梧桐。枝枝相覆盖，叶叶相交通。中有双飞鸟，自名为鸳鸯。仰头相向鸣，夜夜达五更。行人驻足听，寡妇起彷徨。多谢后世人，戒之慎勿忘。",,,GPT-4o,古文学,中文,这段文字出自《孔雀东南飞》，讲述了东汉末年庐江府小吏焦仲卿和妻子刘兰芝之间的爱情悲剧。因仲卿母亲不满兰芝的行为，坚持要遣走兰芝，导致夫妻二人被迫分离。兰芝被迫返回娘家后，家人强逼她改嫁他人，但兰芝与仲卿相爱至深，誓不再嫁，最终投水自尽。仲卿得知兰芝的死讯，悲痛欲绝，自缢于庭树。两人死后合葬，象征着他们深厚的爱情故事。,2256
"汉末建安中，庐江府小吏焦仲卿妻刘氏，为仲卿母所遣，自誓不嫁。其家逼之，乃投水而死。仲卿闻之，亦自缢于庭树。时人伤之，为诗云尔。
孔雀东南飞，五里一徘徊。
“十三能织素，十四学裁衣。十五弹箜篌，十六诵诗书。十七为君妇，心中常苦悲。君既为府吏，守节情不移。贱妾留空房，相见常日稀。鸡鸣入机织，夜夜不得息。三日断五匹，大人故嫌迟。非为织作迟，君家妇难为！妾不堪驱使，徒留无所施。便可白公姥，及时相遣归。”
府吏得闻之，堂上启阿母：“儿已薄禄相，幸复得此妇。结发同枕席，黄泉共为友。共事二三年，始尔未为久。女行无偏斜，何意致不厚。”
阿母谓府吏：“何乃太区区！此妇无礼节，举动自专由。吾意久怀忿，汝岂得自由！东家有贤女，自名秦罗敷。可怜体无比，阿母为汝求。便可速遣之，遣去慎莫留！”
府吏长跪告：“伏惟启阿母。今若遣此妇，终老不复取！”
阿母得闻之，槌床便大怒：“小子无所畏，何敢助妇语！吾已失恩义，会不相从许！”
府吏默无声，再拜还入户。举言谓新妇，哽咽不能语：“我自不驱卿，逼迫有阿母。卿但暂还家，吾今且报府。不久当归还，还必相迎取。以此下心意，慎勿违吾语。”
新妇谓府吏：“勿复重纷纭。往昔初阳岁，谢家来贵门。奉事循公姥，进止敢自专？昼夜勤作息，伶俜萦苦辛。谓言无罪过，供养卒大恩；仍更被驱遣，何言复来还！妾有绣腰襦，葳蕤自生光；红罗复斗帐，四角垂香囊；箱帘六七十，绿碧青丝绳，物物各自异，种种在其中。人贱物亦鄙，不足迎后人，留待作遗施，于今无会因。时时为安慰，久久莫相忘！”
鸡鸣外欲曙，新妇起严妆。著我绣夹裙，事事四五通。足下蹑丝履，头上玳瑁光。腰若流纨素，耳著明月珰。指如削葱根，口如含朱丹。纤纤作细步，精妙世无双。
上堂拜阿母，阿母怒不止。“昔作女儿时，生小出野里。本自无教训，兼愧贵家子。受母钱帛多，不堪母驱使。今日还家去，念母劳家里。”却与小姑别，泪落连珠子。“新妇初来时，小姑始扶床；今日被驱遣，小姑如我长。勤心养公姥，好自相扶将。初七及下九，嬉戏莫相忘。”出门登车去，涕落百余行。
府吏马在前，新妇车在后。隐隐何甸甸，俱会大道口。下马入车中，低头共耳语：“誓不相隔卿，且暂还家去。吾今且赴府，不久当还归。誓天不相负！”
新妇谓府吏：“感君区区怀！君既若见录，不久望君来。君当作磐石，妾当作蒲苇。蒲苇纫如丝，磐石无转移。我有亲父兄，性行暴如雷，恐不任我意，逆以煎我怀。”举手长劳劳，二情同依依 。
入门上家堂，进退无颜仪。阿母大拊掌，不图子自归：“十三教汝织，十四能裁衣，十五弹箜篌，十六知礼仪，十七遣汝嫁，谓言无誓违。汝今何罪过，不迎而自归？”兰芝惭阿母：“儿实无罪过。”阿母大悲摧。
还家十余日，县令遣媒来。云有第三郎，窈窕世无双。年始十八九，便言多令才。
阿母谓阿女：“汝可去应之。”
阿女含泪答：“兰芝初还时，府吏见丁宁，结誓不别离。今日违情义，恐此事非奇。自可断来信，徐徐更谓之。”
阿母白媒人：“贫贱有此女，始适还家门。不堪吏人妇，岂合令郎君？幸可广问讯，不得便相许。”
媒人去数日，寻遣丞请还，说有兰家女，承籍有宦官。云有第五郎，娇逸未有婚。遣丞为媒人，主簿通语言。直说太守家，有此令郎君，既欲结大义，故遣来贵门。
阿母谢媒人：“女子先有誓，老姥岂敢言！”
阿兄得闻之，怅然心中烦。举言谓阿妹：“作计何不量！先嫁得府吏，后嫁得郎君。否泰如天地，足以荣汝身。不嫁义郎体，其往欲何云？”
兰芝仰头答：“理实如兄言。谢家事夫婿，中道还兄门。处分适兄意，那得自任专！虽与府吏要，渠会永无缘。登即相许和，便可作婚姻。”媒人下床去。诺诺复尔尔。还部白府君：“下官奉使命，言谈大有缘。”府君得闻之，心中大欢喜。视历复开书，便利此月内，六合正相应。良吉三十日，今已二十七，卿可去成婚。交语速装束，络绎如浮云。青雀白鹄舫，四角龙子幡。婀娜随风转，金车玉作轮。踯躅青骢马，流苏金镂鞍。赍钱三百万，皆用青丝穿。杂彩三百匹，交广市鲑珍。从人四五百，郁郁登郡门。
阿母谓阿女：“适得府君书，明日来迎汝。何不作衣裳？莫令事不举！”
阿女默无声，手巾掩口啼，泪落便如泻。移我琉璃榻，出置前窗下。左手持刀尺，右手执绫罗。朝成绣夹裙，晚成单罗衫。晻晻日欲暝，愁思出门啼。
府吏闻此变，因求假暂归。未至二三里，摧藏马悲哀。新妇识马声，蹑履相逢迎。怅然遥相望，知是故人来。举手拍马鞍，嗟叹使心伤：“自君别我后，人事不可量。果不如先愿，又非君所详。我有亲父母，逼迫兼弟兄。以我应他人，君还何所望！”
府吏谓新妇：“贺卿得高迁！磐石方且厚，可以卒千年；蒲苇一时纫，便作旦夕间。卿当日胜贵，吾独向黄泉！”
新妇谓府吏：“何意出此言！同是被逼迫，君尔妾亦然。黄泉下相见，勿违今日言！”执手分道去，各各还家门。生人作死别，恨恨那可论？念与世间辞，千万不复全！
府吏还家去，上堂拜阿母：“今日大风寒，寒风摧树木，严霜结庭兰。儿今日冥冥，令母在后单。故作不良计，勿复怨鬼神！命如南山石，四体康且直！”
阿母得闻之，零泪应声落：“汝是大家子，仕宦于台阁。慎勿为妇死，贵贱情何薄！东家有贤女，窈窕艳城郭，阿母为汝求，便复在旦夕。”
府吏再拜还，长叹空房中，作计乃尔立。转头向户里，渐见愁煎迫。

昭阳殿里恩爱绝，蓬莱宫中日月长。
回头下望人寰处，不见长安见尘雾。
惟将旧物表深情，钿合金钗寄将去。
钗留一股合一扇，钗擘黄金合分钿。
但令心似金钿坚，天上人间会相见。
临别殷勤重寄词，词中有誓两心知。
七月七日长生殿，夜半无人私语时。
在天愿作比翼鸟，在地愿为连理枝。
天长地久有时尽，此恨绵绵无绝期。",,,GPT-4o,古文学,中文,这段文字出自唐代诗人白居易的《长恨歌》，描述了唐玄宗与杨贵妃之间的爱情故事。开头讲述了唐玄宗对杨贵妃的宠爱，在她入宫后，两人度过了一段甜蜜时光。接着，安史之乱爆发，杨贵妃被逼自尽，玄宗悲痛不已。之后，两人阴阳相隔，玄宗思念成疾，最终通过方士在仙山中与杨贵妃再会，表达了他们永不消逝的爱情和无尽的哀恨。,960

"元和十年，予左迁九江郡司马。明年秋，送客湓浦口，闻舟中夜弹琵琶者，听其音，铮铮然有京都声。问其人，本长安倡女，尝学琵琶于穆、曹二善才，年长色衰，委身为贾人妇。遂命酒，使快弹数曲。曲罢悯然，自叙少小时欢乐事，今漂沦憔悴，转徙于江湖间。予出官二年，恬然自安，感斯人言，是夕始觉有迁谪意。因为长句，歌以赠之，凡六百一十六言，命曰《琵琶行》。
浔阳江头夜送客，枫叶荻花秋瑟瑟。
主人下马客在船，举酒欲饮无管弦。
醉不成欢惨将别，别时茫茫江浸月。
忽闻水上琵琶声，主人忘归客不发。
寻声暗问弹者谁，琵琶声停欲语迟。
移船相近邀相见，添酒回灯重开宴。
千呼万唤始出来，犹抱琵琶半遮面。
转轴拨弦三两声，未成曲调先有情。
弦弦掩抑声声思，似诉平生不得志。
低眉信手续续弹，说尽心中无限事。
轻拢慢捻抹复挑，初为《霓裳》后《六幺》。
大弦嘈嘈如急雨，小弦切切如私语。
嘈嘈切切错杂弹，大珠小珠落玉盘。
间关莺语花底滑，幽咽泉流冰下难。
冰泉冷涩弦凝绝，凝绝不通声暂歇。
别有幽愁暗恨生，此时无声胜有声。
银瓶乍破水浆迸，铁骑突出刀枪鸣。
曲终收拨当心画，四弦一声如裂帛。
东船西舫悄无言，唯见江心秋月白。
沉吟放拨插弦中，整顿衣裳起敛容。
自言本是京城女，家在虾蟆陵下住。
十三学得琵琶成，名属教坊第一部。
曲罢曾教善才服，妆成每被秋娘妒。
五陵年少争缠头，一曲红绡不知数。
钿头银篦击节碎，血色罗裙翻酒污
今年欢笑复明年，秋月春风等闲度。
弟走从军阿姨死，暮去朝来颜色故。
门前冷落鞍马稀，老大嫁作商人妇。
商人重利轻别离，前月浮梁买茶去。
去来江口守空船，绕船月明江水寒。
夜深忽梦少年事，梦啼妆泪红阑干。
我闻琵琶已叹息，又闻此语重唧唧。
同是天涯沦落人，相逢何必曾相识！
我从去年辞帝京，谪居卧病浔阳城。
浔阳地僻无音乐，终岁不闻丝竹声。
住近湓江地低湿，黄芦苦竹绕宅生。
其间旦暮闻何物？杜鹃啼血猿哀鸣。
春江花朝秋月夜，往往取酒还独倾。
岂无山歌与村笛，呕哑嘲哳难为听。
今夜闻君琵琶语，如听仙乐耳暂明。
莫辞更坐弹一曲，为君翻作《琵琶行》。
感我此言良久立，却坐促弦弦转急。
凄凄不似向前声，满座重闻皆掩泣。

What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me?
Help, help, ho!

If it be made of penetrable stuff;
If damned custom have not braz’d it so,
That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
QUEEN.
What have I done, that thou dar’st wag thy tongue
In noise so rude against me?
HAMLET.
Such an act
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
And sets a blister there. Makes marriage vows
As false as dicers’ oaths. O such a deed
As from the body of contraction plucks
The very soul, and sweet religion makes
A rhapsody of words. Heaven’s face doth glow,
Yea this solidity and compound mass,
With tristful visage, as against the doom,
Is thought-sick at the act.
QUEEN.
Ay me, what act,
That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
HAMLET.
Look here upon this picture, and on this,
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
See what a grace was seated on this brow,
Hyperion’s curls, the front of Jove himself,
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command,
A station like the herald Mercury
New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
A combination and a form indeed,
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
To give the world assurance of a man.
This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
Here is your husband, like a mildew’d ear
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
You cannot call it love; for at your age
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it’s humble,
And waits upon the judgement: and what judgement
Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
Is apoplex’d, for madness would not err
Nor sense to ecstacy was ne’er so thrall’d
But it reserv’d some quantity of choice
To serve in such a difference. What devil was’t
That thus hath cozen’d you at hoodman-blind?
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
Or but a sickly part of one true sense
Could not so mope. O shame! where is thy blush?
Rebellious hell,
If thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones,
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
And reason panders will.
QUEEN.
O Hamlet, speak no more.
Thou turn’st mine eyes into my very soul,
And there I see such black and grained spots
As will not leave their tinct.
HAMLET.
Nay, but to live
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
Stew’d in corruption, honeying and making love
Over the nasty sty.
QUEEN.
O speak to me no more;
These words like daggers enter in mine ears;
No more, sweet Hamlet.
HAMLET.
A murderer and a villain;
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
Of your precedent lord. A vice of kings,
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,

And put it in his pocket!
QUEEN.
No more.

That, laps’d in time and passion, lets go by
The important acting of your dread command?

Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
But look, amazement on thy mother sits.

Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
Speak to her, Hamlet.

How is it with you, lady?

Alas, how is’t with you,
That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep,
And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
HAMLET.
On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares,
His form and cause conjoin’d, preaching to stones,
Would make them capable.—Do not look upon me,
Lest with this piteous action you convert
My stern effects. Then what I have to do
Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.

As from the body of contraction plucks
The very soul, and sweet religion makes
A rhapsody of words. Heaven’s face doth glow,
Yea this solidity and compound mass,
With tristful visage, as against the doom,
Is thought-sick at the act.
QUEEN.
Ay me, what act,
That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
HAMLET.
Look here upon this picture, and on this,
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
See what a grace was seated on this brow,
Hyperion’s curls, the front of Jove himself,
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command,
A station like the herald Mercury
New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
A combination and a form indeed,
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
To give the world assurance of a man.
This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
Here is your husband, like a mildew’d ear
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
You cannot call it love; for at your age
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it’s humble,
And waits upon the judgement: and what judgement
Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
Is apoplex’d, for madness would not err
Nor sense to ecstacy was ne’er so thrall’d
But it reserv’d some quantity of choice
To serve in such a difference. What devil was’t
That thus hath cozen’d you at hoodman-blind?
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
Or but a sickly part of one true sense
Could not so mope. O shame! where is thy blush?
Rebellious hell,
If thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones,
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
And reason panders will.
QUEEN.
O Hamlet, speak no more.
Thou turn’st mine eyes into my very soul,
And there I see such black and grained spots
As will not leave their tinct.
HAMLET.
Nay, but to live
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
Stew’d in corruption, honeying and making love
Over the nasty sty.
QUEEN.
O speak to me no more;
These words like daggers enter in mine ears;
No more, sweet Hamlet.
HAMLET.
A murderer and a villain;
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
Of your precedent lord. A vice of kings,
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
And put it in his pocket!
QUEEN.
No more.
HAMLET.
A king of shreds and patches!—
Enter Ghost.
Save me and hover o’er me with your wings,
You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
QUEEN.
Alas, he’s mad.
HAMLET.
Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
That, laps’d in time and passion, lets go by
The important acting of your dread command?
O say!
GHOST.
Do not forget. This visitation
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
O step between her and her fighting soul.
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
Speak to her, Hamlet.
HAMLET.
How is it with you, lady?
QUEEN.
Alas, how is’t with you,
That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep,
And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
HAMLET.
On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares,
His form and cause conjoin’d, preaching to stones,
Would make them capable.—Do not look upon me,
Lest with this piteous action you convert
My stern effects. Then what I have to do
Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
QUEEN.
To whom do you speak this?
HAMLET.
Do you see nothing there?
QUEEN.
Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
HAMLET.
Nor did you nothing hear?
QUEEN.
No, nothing but ourselves.
HAMLET.
Why, look you there! look how it steals away!
My father, in his habit as he liv’d!
Look where he goes even now out at the portal.",,,GPT-4o,古文学,英文,"In this passage from 'Hamlet,' Hamlet confronts his mother, Queen Gertrude, about her marriage to his uncle Claudius, shortly after the death of Hamlet's father. The confrontation escalates when Hamlet accidentally kills Polonius, who is hiding behind a curtain, thinking he was Claudius. Hamlet harshly criticizes his mother's actions, claiming they are immoral and dishonorable. The tension between mother and son is palpable as Hamlet expresses his deep disappointment and anger. The appearance of the Ghost of King Hamlet adds to the drama, as he reminds Hamlet of his mission and urges him to speak gently to Gertrude. The Queen, unable to see the Ghost, believes Hamlet is mad and listens in horror as Hamlet describes the Ghost's presence.",1092
"MALCOLM.
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there
Weep our sad bosoms empty.
MACDUFF.
Let us rather
Hold fast the mortal sword, and, like good men,
Bestride our down-fall’n birthdom. Each new morn
New widows howl, new orphans cry; new sorrows
Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds
As if it felt with Scotland, and yell’d out
Like syllable of dolour.
MALCOLM.
What I believe, I’ll wail;
What know, believe; and what I can redress,
As I shall find the time to friend, I will.
What you have spoke, it may be so, perchance.
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
Was once thought honest: you have loved him well;
He hath not touch’d you yet. I am young; but something
You may deserve of him through me; and wisdom
To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb
To appease an angry god.
MACDUFF.
I am not treacherous.
MALCOLM.
But Macbeth is.
A good and virtuous nature may recoil
In an imperial charge. But I shall crave your pardon.
That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell:
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,
Yet grace must still look so.
MACDUFF.
I have lost my hopes.
MALCOLM.
Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
Why in that rawness left you wife and child,
Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,
Without leave-taking?—I pray you,
Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,
But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,
Whatever I shall think.
MACDUFF.
Bleed, bleed, poor country!
Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,
For goodness dare not check thee! wear thou thy wrongs;
The title is affeer’d.—Fare thee well, lord:
I would not be the villain that thou think’st
For the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp
And the rich East to boot.
MALCOLM.
Be not offended:
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash
Is added to her wounds. I think, withal,
There would be hands uplifted in my right;
And here, from gracious England, have I offer
Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,
When I shall tread upon the tyrant’s head,
Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
Shall have more vices than it had before,
More suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,
By him that shall succeed.
MACDUFF.
What should he be?
MALCOLM.
It is myself I mean; in whom I know
All the particulars of vice so grafted
That, when they shall be open’d, black Macbeth
Will seem as pure as snow; and the poor state
Esteem him as a lamb, being compar’d
With my confineless harms.
MACDUFF.
Not in the legions
Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn’d
In evils to top Macbeth.
MALCOLM.
I grant him bloody,
Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
That has a name: but there’s no bottom, none,
In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,
Your matrons, and your maids, could not fill up
The cistern of my lust; and my desire
All continent impediments would o’erbear,
That did oppose my will: better Macbeth
Than such an one to reign.
MACDUFF.
Boundless intemperance
In nature is a tyranny; it hath been
Th’ untimely emptying of the happy throne,
And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
To take upon you what is yours: you may
Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,
And yet seem cold—the time you may so hoodwink.
We have willing dames enough; there cannot be
That vulture in you, to devour so many
As will to greatness dedicate themselves,
Finding it so inclin’d.
MALCOLM.
With this there grows
In my most ill-compos’d affection such
A staunchless avarice, that, were I king,
I should cut off the nobles for their lands;
Desire his jewels, and this other’s house:
And my more-having would be as a sauce
To make me hunger more; that I should forge
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
Destroying them for wealth.
MACDUFF.
This avarice
Sticks deeper; grows with more pernicious root
Than summer-seeming lust; and it hath been
The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;
Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will,
Of your mere own. All these are portable,
With other graces weigh’d.
MALCOLM.
But I have none: the king-becoming graces,
As justice, verity, temp’rance, stableness,
Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
I have no relish of them; but abound
In the division of each several crime,
Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
Uproar the universal peace, confound
All unity on earth.
MACDUFF.

No, not to live.—O nation miserable,
With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter’d,
When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
Since that the truest issue of thy throne
By his own interdiction stands accus’d,
And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father
Was a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee,
Oft’ner upon her knees than on her feet,
Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!
These evils thou repeat’st upon thyself
Have banish’d me from Scotland.—O my breast,
Thy hope ends here!
MALCOLM.
Macduff, this noble passion,
Child of integrity, hath from my soul
Wiped the black scruples, reconcil’d my thoughts
To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth
By many of these trains hath sought to win me
Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
From over-credulous haste: but God above
Deal between thee and me! for even now
I put myself to thy direction, and
Unspeak mine own detraction; here abjure
The taints and blames I laid upon myself,
For strangers to my nature. I am yet
Unknown to woman; never was forsworn;
Scarcely have coveted what was mine own;
At no time broke my faith; would not betray
The devil to his fellow; and delight
No less in truth than life: my first false speaking
Was this upon myself. What I am truly,
Is thine and my poor country’s to command:
Whither, indeed, before thy here-approach,
Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,
Already at a point, was setting forth.

"CHORUS. When Faustus had with pleasure ta’en the view
Of rarest things, and royal courts of kings,
He stay’d his course, and so returned home;
Where such as bear his absence but with grief,
I mean his friends and near’st companions,
Did gratulate his safety with kind words,
And in their conference of what befell,
Touching his journey through the world and air,
They put forth questions of astrology,
Which Faustus answer’d with such learned skill
As they admir’d and wonder’d at his wit.
Now is his fame spread forth in every land:
Amongst the rest the Emperor is one,
Carolus the Fifth, at whose palace now
Faustus is feasted ’mongst his noblemen.
What there he did, in trial of his art,
I leave untold; your eyes shall see[’t] perform’d.
[Exit.]

Enter ROBIN123 the Ostler, with a book in his hand.

ROBIN. O, this is admirable! here I ha’ stolen one of Doctor
Faustus’ conjuring-books, and, i’faith, I mean to search some
circles for my own use. Now will I make all the maidens in our
parish dance at my pleasure, stark naked, before me; and so
by that means I shall see more than e’er I felt or saw yet.

Enter RALPH, calling ROBIN.

RALPH. Robin, prithee, come away; there’s a gentleman tarries
to have his horse, and he would have his things rubbed and made
clean: he keeps such a chafing with my mistress about it; and
she has sent me to look thee out; prithee, come away.

ROBIN. Keep out, keep out, or else you are blown up, you are
dismembered, Ralph: keep out, for I am about a roaring piece
of work.

RALPH. Come, what doest thou with that same book? thou canst
not read?

ROBIN. Yes, my master and mistress shall find that I can read,
he for his forehead, she for her private study; she’s born to
bear with me, or else my art fails.

RALPH. Why, Robin, what book is that?

ROBIN. What book! why, the most intolerable book for conjuring
that e’er was invented by any brimstone devil.

RALPH. Canst thou conjure with it?

ROBIN. I can do all these things easily with it; first, I can
make thee drunk with ippocras124 at any tabern125 in Europe
for nothing; that’s one of my conjuring works.

RALPH. Our Master Parson says that’s nothing.

ROBIN. True, Ralph: and more, Ralph, if thou hast any mind to
Nan Spit, our kitchen-maid, then turn her and wind her to thy own
use, as often as thou wilt, and at midnight.

RALPH. O, brave, Robin! shall I have Nan Spit, and to mine own

ROBIN. Come, Ralph: did not I tell thee, we were for ever made

purchase127 for horse-keepers: our horses shall eat no hay as

RALPH. But, Robin, here comes the Vintner.

ROBIN. Hush! I’ll gull him supernaturally.

Enter VINTNER.

Drawer,128 I hope all is paid; God be with you!—Come, Ralph.

VINTNER. Soft, sir; a word with you. I must yet have a goblet paid
from you, ere you go.

ROBIN. I a goblet, Ralph, I a goblet!—I scorn you; and you are

VINTNER. I mean so, sir, with your favour.
[Searches ROBIN.]

ROBIN. How say you now?

VINTNER. I must say somewhat to your fellow.—You, sir!

RALPH. Me, sir! me, sir! search your fill. [VINTNER searches him.]
Now, sir, you may be ashamed to burden honest men with a matter
of truth.

VINTNER. Well, tone129 of you hath this goblet about you.

ROBIN. You lie, drawer, ’tis afore me [Aside].—Sirrah you, I’ll
teach you to impeach honest men;—stand by;—I’ll scour you for
a goblet;—stand aside you had best, I charge you in the name of
Belzebub.—Look to the goblet, Ralph [Aside to RALPH].

ROBIN. O, this is admirable! here I ha’ stolen one of Doctor

parish dance at my pleasure, stark naked, before me; and so
by that means I shall see more than e’er I felt or saw yet.

Enter RALPH, calling ROBIN.

RALPH. Robin, prithee, come away; there’s a gentleman tarries
to have his horse, and he would have his things rubbed and made
clean: he keeps such a chafing with my mistress about it; and
she has sent me to look thee out; prithee, come away.

ROBIN. Keep out, keep out, or else you are blown up, you are
dismembered, Ralph: keep out, for I am about a roaring piece
of work.

RALPH. Come, what doest thou with that same book? thou canst
not read?

ROBIN. Yes, my master and mistress shall find that I can read,
he for his forehead, she for her private study; she’s born to
bear with me, or else my art fails.

RALPH. Why, Robin, what book is that?

ROBIN. What book! why, the most intolerable book for conjuring
that e’er was invented by any brimstone devil.

RALPH. Canst thou conjure with it?

ROBIN. I can do all these things easily with it; first, I can
make thee drunk with ippocras124 at any tabern125 in Europe
for nothing; that’s one of my conjuring works.

RALPH. Our Master Parson says that’s nothing.

ROBIN. True, Ralph: and more, Ralph, if thou hast any mind to
Nan Spit, our kitchen-maid, then turn her and wind her to thy own
use, as often as thou wilt, and at midnight.

"When Phoebus dwelled here in earth adown,
As olde bookes make mentioun,
He was the moste lusty* bacheler *pleasant
Of all this world, and eke* the best archer. *also
He slew Python the serpent, as he lay
Sleeping against the sun upon a day;
And many another noble worthy deed
He with his bow wrought, as men maye read.
Playen he could on every minstrelsy,
And singe, that it was a melody
To hearen of his cleare voice the soun’.
Certes the king of Thebes, Amphioun,
That with his singing walled the city,
Could never singe half so well as he.
Thereto he was the seemlieste man
That is, or was since that the world began;
What needeth it his features to descrive?
For in this world is none so fair alive.
He was therewith full fill’d of gentleness,
Of honour, and of perfect worthiness.
This Phoebus, that was flower of bach’lery,
As well in freedom* as in chivalry, *generosity
For his disport, in sign eke of victory
Of Python, so as telleth us the story,
Was wont to bearen in his hand a bow.
Now had this Phoebus in his house a crow,
Which in a cage he foster’d many a day,
And taught it speaken, as men teach a jay.
White was this crow, as is a snow-white swan,
And counterfeit the speech of every man
He coulde, when he shoulde tell a tale.
Therewith in all this world no nightingale
Ne coulde by an hundred thousand deal* *part
Singe so wondrous merrily and well.
Now had this Phoebus in his house a wife;
Which that he loved more than his life.
And night and day did ever his diligence
Her for to please, and do her reverence:
Save only, if that I the sooth shall sayn,
Jealous he was, and would have kept her fain.
For him were loth y-japed* for to be; *tricked, deceived
And so is every wight in such degree;
But all for nought, for it availeth nought.
A good wife, that is clean of work and thought,
Should not be kept in none await* certain: *observation
And truely the labour is in vain
To keep a shrewe,* for it will not be. *ill-disposed woman
This hold I for a very nicety,* *sheer folly
To spille* labour for to keepe wives; *lose
Thus writen olde clerkes in their lives.
But now to purpose, as I first began.
This worthy Phoebus did all that he can
To please her, weening, through such pleasance,
And for his manhood and his governance,
That no man should have put him from her grace;
But, God it wot, there may no man embrace
As to distrain* a thing, which that nature *succeed in constraining
Hath naturally set in a creature.
Take any bird, and put it in a cage,
And do all thine intent, and thy corage,* *what thy heart prompts
To foster it tenderly with meat and drink
Of alle dainties that thou canst bethink,
And keep it all so cleanly as thou may;
Although the cage of gold be never so gay,
Yet had this bird, by twenty thousand fold,
Lever* in a forest, both wild and cold, *rather
Go eate wormes, and such wretchedness.
For ever this bird will do his business
T’escape out of his cage when that he may:
His liberty the bird desireth aye. <2>
Let take a cat, and foster her with milk
And tender flesh, and make her couch of silk,
And let her see a mouse go by the wall,
Anon she weiveth* milk, and flesh, and all, *forsaketh
And every dainty that is in that house,
Such appetite hath she to eat the mouse.
Lo, here hath kind* her domination, *nature
And appetite flemeth* discretion. *drives out
A she-wolf hath also a villain’s kind
The lewedeste wolf that she may find,
Or least of reputation, will she take
In time when *her lust* to have a make.* *she desires *mate
All these examples speak I by* these men *with reference to
That be untrue, and nothing by women.
For men have ever a lik’rous appetite
On lower things to perform their delight
Than on their wives, be they never so fair,
Never so true, nor so debonair.* *gentle, mild
Flesh is so newefangled, *with mischance,* *ill luck to it*
That we can in no thinge have pleasance
That *souneth unto* virtue any while. *accords with
This Phoebus, which that thought upon no guile,
Deceived was for all his jollity;
For under him another hadde she,
A man of little reputation,
Nought worth to Phoebus in comparison.
The more harm is; it happens often so,
Of which there cometh muche harm and woe.
And so befell, when Phoebus was absent,
His wife anon hath for her leman* sent. *unlawful lover
Her leman! certes that is a knavish speech.
Forgive it me, and that I you beseech.
The wise Plato saith, as ye may read,
The word must needs accorde with the deed;
If men shall telle properly a thing,
The word must cousin be to the working.
I am a boistous* man, right thus I say. *rough-spoken, downright
There is no difference truely
Betwixt a wife that is of high degree
(If of her body dishonest she be),
And any poore wench, other than this
(If it so be they worke both amiss),
But, for* the gentle is in estate above, *because
She shall be call’d his lady and his love;
And, for that other is a poor woman,
She shall be call’d his wench and his leman:
And God it wot, mine owen deare brother,
Men lay the one as low as lies the other.
Right so betwixt a *titleless tyrant* *usurper*
And an outlaw, or else a thief errant, *wandering
The same I say, there is no difference
(To Alexander told was this sentence),
But, for the tyrant is of greater might
By force of meinie* for to slay downright, *followers
And burn both house and home, and make all plain,* *level
Lo, therefore is he call’d a capitain;
And, for the outlaw hath but small meinie,
And may not do so great an harm as he,
Nor bring a country to so great mischief,
Men calle him an outlaw or a thief.
But, for I am a man not textuel, *learned in texts
I will not tell of texts never a deal;* *whit
I will go to my tale, as I began.
When Phoebus’ wife had sent for her leman,
Anon they wroughten all their *lust volage.* *light or rash pleasure*
This white crow, that hung aye in the cage,
Beheld their work, and said never a word;
And when that home was come Phoebus the lord,
This crowe sung, “Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo!”
“What? bird,” quoth Phoebus, “what song sing’st thou now?
Wert thou not wont so merrily to sing,
That to my heart it was a rejoicing
To hear thy voice? alas! what song is this?”
“By God,” quoth he, “I singe not amiss.
Phoebus,” quoth he, “for all thy worthiness,
For all thy beauty, and all thy gentleness,
For all thy song, and all thy minstrelsy,
*For all thy waiting, bleared is thine eye* *despite all thy watching,
With one of little reputation, thou art befooled*
Not worth to thee, as in comparison,
The mountance* of a gnat, so may I thrive; *value
For on thy bed thy wife I saw him swive.”
What will ye more? the crow anon him told,
By sade* tokens, and by wordes bold, *grave, trustworthy
How that his wife had done her lechery,
To his great shame and his great villainy;
And told him oft, he saw it with his eyen.
This Phoebus gan awayward for to wrien;* *turn aside

His bow he bent, and set therein a flo,* *arrow
And in his ire he hath his wife slain;
This is th’ effect, there is no more to sayn.
For sorrow of which he brake his minstrelsy,
Both harp and lute, gitern* and psaltery; *guitar
And eke he brake his arrows and his bow;
And after that thus spake he to the crow.",,,GPT-4o,古文学,英文,"The passage tells the story of Phoebus, an admirable and talented archer, singer, and musician from ancient mythology.

He was the moste lusty* bacheler *pleasant
Of all this world, and eke* the best archer. *also
He slew Python the serpent, as he lay
Sleeping against the sun upon a day;
And many another noble worthy deed
He with his bow wrought, as men maye read.
Playen he could on every minstrelsy,
And singe, that it was a melody
To hearen of his cleare voice the soun’.
Certes the king of Thebes, Amphioun,
That with his singing walled the city,
Could never singe half so well as he.
Thereto he was the seemlieste man
That is, or was since that the world began;
What needeth it his features to descrive?
For in this world is none so fair alive.
He was therewith full fill’d of gentleness,
Of honour, and of perfect worthiness.
This Phoebus, that was flower of bach’lery,
As well in freedom* as in chivalry, *generosity
For his disport, in sign eke of victory
Of Python, so as telleth us the story,
Was wont to bearen in his hand a bow.
Now had this Phoebus in his house a crow,
Which in a cage he foster’d many a day,
And taught it speaken, as men teach a jay.
White was this crow, as is a snow-white swan,
And counterfeit the speech of every man
He coulde, when he shoulde tell a tale.
Therewith in all this world no nightingale
Ne coulde by an hundred thousand deal* *part
Singe so wondrous merrily and well.
Now had this Phoebus in his house a wife;
Which that he loved more than his life.
And night and day did ever his diligence
Her for to please, and do her reverence:
Save only, if that I the sooth shall sayn,
Jealous he was, and would have kept her fain.
For him were loth y-japed* for to be; *tricked, deceived
And so is every wight in such degree;
But all for nought, for it availeth nought.
A good wife, that is clean of work and thought,
Should not be kept in none await* certain: *observation
And truely the labour is in vain
To keep a shrewe,* for it will not be. *ill-disposed woman
This hold I for a very nicety,* *sheer folly
To spille* labour for to keepe wives; *lose
Thus writen olde clerkes in their lives.
But now to purpose, as I first began.
This worthy Phoebus did all that he can
To please her, weening, through such pleasance,
And for his manhood and his governance,
That no man should have put him from her grace;
But, God it wot, there may no man embrace
As to distrain* a thing, which that nature *succeed in constraining
Hath naturally set in a creature.
Take any bird, and put it in a cage,
And do all thine intent, and thy corage,* *what thy heart prompts
To foster it tenderly with meat and drink
Of alle dainties that thou canst bethink,
And keep it all so cleanly as thou may;
Although the cage of gold be never so gay,
Yet had this bird, by twenty thousand fold,
Lever* in a forest, both wild and cold, *rather
Go eate wormes, and such wretchedness.
For ever this bird will do his business
T’escape out of his cage when that he may:
His liberty the bird desireth aye. <4>
Let take a cat, and foster her with milk
And tender flesh, and make her couch of silk,
And let her see a mouse go by the wall,
Anon she weiveth* milk, and flesh, and all, *forsaketh
And every dainty that is in that house,
Such appetite hath she to eat the mouse.
Lo, here hath kind* her domination, *nature
And appetite flemeth* discretion. *drives out
A she-wolf hath also a villain’s kind
The lewedeste wolf that she may find,
Or least of reputation, will she take
In time when *her lust* to have a make.* *she desires *mate
All these examples speak I by* these men *with reference to
That be untrue, and nothing by women.
For men have ever a lik’rous appetite
On lower things to perform their delight
Than on their wives, be they never so fair,
Never so true, nor so debonair.* *gentle, mild
Flesh is so newefangled, *with mischance,* *ill luck to it*
That we can in no thinge have pleasance
That *souneth unto* virtue any while. *accords with
This Phoebus, which that thought upon no guile,
Deceived was for all his jollity;
For under him another hadde she,
A man of little reputation,
Nought worth to Phoebus in comparison.
The more harm is; it happens often so,
Of which there cometh muche harm and woe.
And so befell, when Phoebus was absent,
His wife anon hath for her leman* sent. *unlawful lover
Her leman! certes that is a knavish speech.
Forgive it me, and that I you beseech.
The wise Plato saith, as ye may read,
The word must needs accorde with the deed;
If men shall telle properly a thing,
The word must cousin be to the working.
I am a boistous* man, right thus I say. *rough-spoken, downright
There is no difference truely
Betwixt a wife that is of high degree
(If of her body dishonest she be),
And any poore wench, other than this
(If it so be they worke both amiss),
But, for* the gentle is in estate above, *because
She shall be call’d his lady and his love;
And, for that other is a poor woman,
She shall be call’d his wench and his leman:
And God it wot, mine owen deare brother,
Men lay the one as low as lies the other.
Right so betwixt a *titleless tyrant* *usurper*
And an outlaw, or else a thief errant, *wandering
The same I say, there is no difference
(To Alexander told was this sentence),
But, for the tyrant is of greater might
By force of meinie* for to slay downright, *followers
And burn both house and home, and make all plain,* *level
Lo, therefore is he call’d a capitain;
And, for the outlaw hath but small meinie,
And may not do so great an harm as he,
Nor bring a country to so great mischief,
Men calle him an outlaw or a thief.
But, for I am a man not textuel, *learned in texts
I will not tell of texts never a deal;* *whit
I will go to my tale, as I began.
When Phoebus’ wife had sent for her leman,
Anon they wroughten all their *lust volage.* *light or rash pleasure*
This white crow, that hung aye in the cage,
Beheld their work, and said never a word;
And when that home was come Phoebus the lord,
This crowe sung, “Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo!”
“What? bird,” quoth Phoebus, “what song sing’st thou now?
Wert thou not wont so merrily to sing,
That to my heart it was a rejoicing
To hear thy voice? alas! what song is this?”
“By God,” quoth he, “I singe not amiss.
Phoebus,” quoth he, “for all thy worthiness,
For all thy beauty, and all thy gentleness,
For all thy song, and all thy minstrelsy,
*For all thy waiting, bleared is thine eye* *despite all thy watching,
With one of little reputation, thou art befooled*
Not worth to thee, as in comparison,
The mountance* of a gnat, so may I thrive; *value
For on thy bed thy wife I saw him swive.”
What will ye more? the crow anon him told,
By sade* tokens, and by wordes bold, *grave, trustworthy
How that his wife had done her lechery,
To his great shame and his great villainy;
And told him oft, he saw it with his eyen.
This Phoebus gan awayward for to wrien;* *turn aside
Him thought his woeful hearte burst in two.
His bow he bent, and set therein a flo,* *arrow
And in his ire he hath his wife slain;
This is th’ effect, there is no more to sayn.
For sorrow of which he brake his minstrelsy,
Both harp and lute, gitern* and psaltery; *guitar
And eke he brake his arrows and his bow;
And after that thus spake he to the crow.",,,GPT-4o,古文学,英文,"The passage tells the story of Phoebus, an admirable and talented archer, singer, and musician from ancient mythology. He had a beautiful and beloved wife who he tried to please and keep loyal. Despite his efforts, she was unfaithful to him with a man of low reputation. Phoebus had a white crow that could mimic human speech and observed the wife's infidelity. Upon Phoebus's return, the crow revealed the wife's betrayal, causing Phoebus great distress. In a fit of rage, Phoebus killed his wife and destroyed his musical instruments and weapons, marking the end of his happiness and artistic endeavors.",1362
"1. No Knowledge without Discernment.
Another faculty we may take notice of in our minds is that of DISCERNING and DISTINGUISHING between the several ideas it has. It is not enough to have a confused perception of something in general. Unless the mind had a distinct perception of different objects and their qualities, it would be capable of very little knowledge, though the bodies that affect us were as busy about us as they are now, and the mind were continually employed in thinking. On this faculty of distinguishing one thing from another depends the evidence and certainty of several, even very general, propositions, which have passed for innate truths;—because men, overlooking the true cause why those propositions find universal assent, impute it wholly to native uniform impressions; whereas it in truth depends upon this clear discerning faculty of the mind, whereby it PERCEIVES two ideas to be the same, or different. But of this more hereafter.
2. The Difference of Wit and Judgment.
How much the imperfection of accurately discriminating ideas one from another lies, either in the dulness or faults of the organs of sense; or want of acuteness, exercise, or attention in the understanding; or hastiness and precipitancy, natural to some tempers, I will not here examine: it suffices to take notice, that this is one of the operations that the mind may reflect on and observe in itself. It is of that consequence to its other knowledge, that so far as this faculty is in itself dull, or not rightly made use of, for the distinguishing one thing from another,—so far our notions are confused, and our reason and judgment disturbed or misled. If in having our ideas in the memory ready at hand consists quickness of parts; in this, of having them unconfused, and being able nicely to distinguish one thing from another, where there is but the least difference, consists, in a great measure, the exactness of judgment, and clearness of reason, which is to be observed in one man above another. And hence perhaps may be given some reason of that common observation,—that men who have a great deal of wit, and prompt memories, have not always the clearest judgment or deepest reason. For WIT lying most in the assemblage of ideas, and putting those together with quickness and variety, wherein can be found any resemblance or congruity, thereby to make up pleasant pictures and agreeable visions in the fancy; JUDGMENT, on the contrary, lies quite on the other side, in separating carefully, one from another, ideas wherein can be found the least difference, thereby to avoid being misled by similitude, and by affinity to take one thing for another. This is a way of proceeding quite contrary to metaphor and allusion; wherein for the most part lies that entertainment and pleasantry of wit, which strikes so lively on the fancy, and therefore is so acceptable to all people, because its beauty appears at first sight, and there is required no labour of thought to examine what truth or reason there is in it. The mind, without looking any further, rests satisfied with the agreeableness of the picture and the gaiety of the fancy. And it is a kind of affront to go about to examine it, by the severe rules of truth and good reason; whereby it appears that it consists in something that is not perfectly conformable to them.
3. Clearness alone hinders Confusion.
To the well distinguishing our ideas, it chiefly contributes that they be CLEAR and DETERMINATE. And when they are so, it will not breed any confusion or mistake about them, though the senses should (as sometimes they do) convey them from the same object differently on different occasions, and so seem to err. For, though a man in a fever should from sugar have a bitter taste, which at another time would produce a sweet one, yet the idea of bitter in that man’s mind would be as clear and distinct from the idea of sweet as if he had tasted only gall. Nor does it make any more confusion between the two ideas of sweet and bitter that the same sort of body produces at one time one, and at another time another idea by the taste, than it makes a confusion in two ideas of white and sweet, or white and round, that the same piece of sugar produces them both in the mind at the same time. And the ideas of orange-colour and azure, that are produced in the mind by the same parcel of the infusion of lignum nephritium, are no less distinct ideas than those of the same colours taken from two very different bodies.
4. Comparing.
The COMPARING them one with another, in respect of extent, degrees, time, place, or any other circumstances, is another operation of the mind about its ideas, and is that upon which depends all that large tribe of ideas comprehended under RELATION; which, of how vast an extent it is, I shall have occasion to consider hereafter.
5. Brutes compare but imperfectly.
How far brutes partake in this faculty, is not easy to determine. I imagine they have it not in any great degree, for, though they probably have several ideas distinct enough, yet it seems to me to be the prerogative of human understanding, when it has sufficiently distinguished any ideas, so as to perceive them to be perfectly different, and so consequently two, to cast about and consider in what circumstances they are capable to be compared. And therefore, I think, beasts compare not their ideas further than some sensible circumstances annexed to the objects themselves. The other power of comparing, which may be observed in men, belonging to general ideas, and useful only to abstract reasonings, we may probably conjecture beasts have not.
6. Compounding.
The next operation we may observe in the mind about its ideas is COMPOSITION; whereby it puts together several of those simple ones it has received from sensation and reflection, and combines them into complex ones. Under this of composition may be reckoned also that of ENLARGING, wherein, though the composition does not so much appear as in more complex ones, yet it is nevertheless a putting several ideas together, though of the same kind. Thus, by adding several units together, we make the idea of a dozen; and putting together the repeated ideas of several perches, we frame that of a furlong.
7. Brutes compound but little.
In this also, I suppose, brutes come far short of man. For, though they take in, and retain together, several combinations of simple ideas, as possibly the shape, smell, and voice of his master make up the complex idea a dog has of him, or rather are so many distinct marks whereby he knows him; yet I do not think they do of themselves ever compound them, and make complex ideas. And perhaps even where we think they have complex ideas, it is only one simple one that directs them in the knowledge of several things, which possibly they distinguish less by their sight than we imagine. For I have been credibly informed that a bitch will nurse, play with, and be fond of young foxes, as much as, and in place of her puppies, if you can but get them once to suck her so long that her milk may go through them. And those animals which have a numerous brood of young ones at once, appear not to have any knowledge of their number; for though they are mightily concerned for any of their young that are taken from them whilst they are in sight or hearing, yet if one or two of them be stolen from them in their absence, or without noise, they appear not to miss them, or to have any sense that their number is lessened.
8. Naming.
When children have, by repeated sensations, got ideas fixed in their memories, they begin by degrees to learn the use of signs. And when they have got the skill to apply the organs of speech to the framing of articulate sounds, they begin to make use of words, to signify their ideas to others. These verbal signs they sometimes borrow from others, and sometimes make themselves, as one may observe among the new and unusual names children often give to things in the first use of language.
9. Abstraction.
The use of words then being to stand as outward mark of our internal ideas, and those ideas being taken from particular things, if every particular idea that we take up should have a distinct name, names must be endless. To prevent this, the mind makes the particular ideas received from particular objects to become general; which is done by considering them as they are in the mind such appearances,—separate from all other existences, and the circumstances of real existence, as time, place, or any other concomitant ideas. This is called ABSTRACTION, whereby ideas taken from particular beings become general representatives of all of the same kind; and their names general names, applicable to whatever exists conformable to such abstract ideas. Such precise, naked appearances in the mind, without considering how, whence, or with what others they came there, the understanding lays up (with names commonly annexed to them) as the standards to rank real existences into sorts, as they agree with these patterns, and to denominate them accordingly. Thus the same colour being observed to-day in chalk or snow, which the mind yesterday received from milk, it considers that appearance alone, makes it a representative of all of that kind; and having given it the name WHITENESS, it by that sound signifies the same quality wheresoever to be imagined or met with; and thus universals, whether ideas or terms, are made.
10. Brutes abstract not.
If it may be doubted whether beasts compound and enlarge their ideas that way to any degree; this, I think, I may be positive in,—that the power of abstracting is not at all in them; and that the having of general ideas is that which puts a perfect distinction betwixt man and brutes, and is an excellency which the faculties of brutes do by no means attain to. For it is evident we observe no footsteps in them of making use of general signs for universal ideas; from which we have reason to imagine that they have not the faculty of abstracting, or making general ideas, since they have no use of words, or any other general signs.",,,GPT-4o,古文学,英文,"This passage explores various mental faculties that humans possess which enable them to gain knowledge and form ideas. It emphasizes the importance of discernment and distinguishing among different ideas for knowledge. It also differentiates between wit, which assembles ideas quickly for creative associations, and judgment, which carefully separates and compares ideas for clear reasoning. The clarity of ideas is crucial to avoid confusion, and the ability to compare and contrast these ideas helps form relations and complex ideas. Animals, the passage argues, lack the advanced ability to compare, compound, abstract, and use general ideas as humans do. These capabilities allow humans to create general concepts and terms, facilitating communication and deeper understanding. The passage underscores that the power of abstraction and generalization significantly distinguishes human intellect from that of animals.",1757

And therefore, I think, beasts compare not their ideas further than some sensible circumstances annexed to the objects themselves. The other power of comparing, which may be observed in men, belonging to general ideas, and useful only to abstract reasonings, we may probably conjecture beasts have not.
6. Compounding.
The next operation we may observe in the mind about its ideas is COMPOSITION; whereby it puts together several of those simple ones it has received from sensation and reflection, and combines them into complex ones. Under this of composition may be reckoned also that of ENLARGING, wherein, though the composition does not so much appear as in more complex ones, yet it is nevertheless a putting several ideas together, though of the same kind. Thus, by adding several units together, we make the idea of a dozen; and putting together the repeated ideas of several perches, we frame that of a furlong.
7. Brutes compound but little.
In this also, I suppose, brutes come far short of man. For, though they take in, and retain together, several combinations of simple ideas, as possibly the shape, smell, and voice of his master make up the complex idea a dog has of him, or rather are so many distinct marks whereby he knows him; yet I do not think they do of themselves ever compound them, and make complex ideas. And perhaps even where we think they have complex ideas, it is only one simple one that directs them in the knowledge of several things, which possibly they distinguish less by their sight than we imagine. For I have been credibly informed that a bitch will nurse, play with, and be fond of young foxes, as much as, and in place of her puppies, if you can but get them once to suck her so long that her milk may go through them. And those animals which have a numerous brood of young ones at once, appear not to have any knowledge of their number; for though they are mightily concerned for any of their young that are taken from them whilst they are in sight or hearing, yet if one or two of them be stolen from them in their absence, or without noise, they appear not to miss them, or to have any sense that their number is lessened.
8. Naming.
When children have, by repeated sensations, got ideas fixed in their memories, they begin by degrees to learn the use of signs. And when they have got the skill to apply the organs of speech to the framing of articulate sounds, they begin to make use of words, to signify their ideas to others. These verbal signs they sometimes borrow from others, and sometimes make themselves, as one may observe among the new and unusual names children often give to things in the first use of language.
9. Abstraction.
The use of words then being to stand as outward mark of our internal ideas, and those ideas being taken from particular things, if every particular idea that we take up should have a distinct name, names must be endless. To prevent this, the mind makes the particular ideas received from particular objects to become general; which is done by considering them as they are in the mind such appearances,—separate from all other existences, and the circumstances of real existence, as time, place, or any other concomitant ideas. This is called ABSTRACTION, whereby ideas taken from particular beings become general representatives of all of the same kind; and their names general names, applicable to whatever exists conformable to such abstract ideas. Such precise, naked appearances in the mind, without considering how, whence, or with what others they came there, the understanding lays up (with names commonly annexed to them) as the standards to rank real existences into sorts, as they agree with these patterns, and to denominate them accordingly. Thus the same colour being observed to-day in chalk or snow, which the mind yesterday received from milk, it considers that appearance alone, makes it a representative of all of that kind; and having given it the name WHITENESS, it by that sound signifies the same quality wheresoever to be imagined or met with; and thus universals, whether ideas or terms, are made.
12. Brutes abstract not.
If it may be doubted whether beasts compound and enlarge their ideas that way to any degree; this, I think, I may be positive in,—that the power of abstracting is not at all in them; and that the having of general ideas is that which puts a perfect distinction betwixt man and brutes, and is an excellency which the faculties of brutes do by no means attain to. For it is evident we observe no footsteps in them of making use of general signs for universal ideas; from which we have reason to imagine that they have not the faculty of abstracting, or making general ideas, since they have no use of words, or any other general signs.",,,GPT-4o,古文学,英文,"This passage explores various mental faculties that humans possess which enable them to gain knowledge and form ideas. It emphasizes the importance of discernment and distinguishing among different ideas for knowledge. It also differentiates between wit, which assembles ideas quickly for creative associations, and judgment, which carefully separates and compares ideas for clear reasoning. The clarity of ideas is crucial to avoid confusion, and the ability to compare and contrast these ideas helps form relations and complex ideas. Animals, the passage argues, lack the advanced ability to compare, compound, abstract, and use general ideas as humans do. These capabilities allow humans to create general concepts and terms, facilitating communication and deeper understanding. The passage underscores that the power of abstraction and generalization significantly distinguishes human intellect from that of animals.",1757

MATHIAS. What make the Jew and Lodowick so private?
I fear me 'tis about fair Abigail.
[Aside.]

BARABAS. [to LODOWICK.] Yonder comes Don Mathias; let us stay: 76
He loves my daughter, and she holds him dear;
But I have sworn to frustrate both their hopes,
And be reveng'd upon the—governor.

[Exit LODOWICK.]

KATHARINE. This Moor is comeliest, is he not? speak, son.

MATHIAS. No, this is the better, mother, view this well.

BARABAS. Seem not to know me here before your mother,
Lest she mistrust the match that is in hand:
When you have brought her home, come to my house;
Think of me as thy father: son, farewell.

MATHIAS. But wherefore talk'd Don Lodowick with you?

BARABAS. Tush, man! we talk'd of diamonds, not of Abigail.

KATHARINE. Tell me, Mathias, is not that the Jew?

BARABAS. As for the comment on the Maccabees,
I have it, sir, and 'tis at your command.

MATHIAS. Yes, madam, and my talk with him was 77
About the borrowing of a book or two.

KATHARINE. Converse not with him; he is cast off from heaven.—
Thou hast thy crowns, fellow.—Come, let's away.

MATHIAS. Sirrah Jew, remember the book.

BARABAS. Marry, will I, sir.

ITHAMORE. Faith, sir, my birth is but mean; my name's Ithamore;
my profession what you please.

BARABAS. Hast thou no trade? then listen to my words,
And I will teach [thee] that shall stick by thee:
First, be thou void of these affections,
Compassion, love, vain hope, and heartless fear;
Be mov'd at nothing, see thou pity none,
But to thyself smile when the Christians moan.

ITHAMORE. O, brave, master! 78 I worship your nose 79 for this.

BARABAS. As for myself, I walk abroad o' nights,
And kill sick people groaning under walls:
Sometimes I go about and poison wells;
And now and then, to cherish Christian thieves,
I am content to lose some of my crowns,
That I may, walking in my gallery,
See 'em go pinion'd along by my door.
Being young, I studied physic, and began
To practice first upon the Italian;
There I enrich'd the priests with burials,
And always kept the sexton's arms in ure 80
With digging graves and ringing dead men's knells:
And, after that, was I an engineer,
And in the wars 'twixt France and Germany,
Under pretence of helping Charles the Fifth,
Slew friend and enemy with my stratagems:
Then, after that, was I an usurer,
And with extorting, cozening, forfeiting,
And tricks belonging unto brokery,
I fill'd the gaols with bankrupts in a year,
And with young orphans planted hospitals;
And every moon made some or other mad,
And now and then one hang himself for grief,
Pinning upon his breast a long great scroll
How I with interest tormented him.
But mark how I am blest for plaguing them;—
I have as much coin as will buy the town.
But tell me now, how hast thou spent thy time?

ITHAMORE. Faith, master,
In setting Christian villages on fire,
Chaining of eunuchs, binding galley-slaves.
One time I was an hostler in an inn,
And in the night-time secretly would I steal
To travellers' chambers, and there cut their throats:
Once at Jerusalem, where the pilgrims kneel'd,
I strewed powder on the marble stones,
And therewithal their knees would rankle so,
That I have laugh'd a-good 81 to see the cripples
Go limping home to Christendom on stilts.

BARABAS. Why, this is something: make account of me
As of thy fellow; we are villains both;
Both circumcised; we hate Christians both:
Be true and secret; thou shalt want no gold.

"[TAMBURLAINE gets up on him into his chair.]

TAMBURLAINE. Now clear the triple region of the air,
And let the Majesty of Heaven behold
Their scourge and terror tread on emperors.
Smile, stars that reign'd at my nativity,
And dim the brightness of your 199 neighbour lamps;
Disdain to borrow light of Cynthia!
For I, the chiefest lamp of all the earth,
First rising in the east with mild aspect,
But fixed now in the meridian line,
Will send up fire to your turning spheres,
And cause the sun to borrow light of you.
My sword struck fire from his coat of steel,
Even in Bithynia, when I took this Turk;
As when a fiery exhalation,
Wrapt in the bowels of a freezing cloud,
Fighting for passage, make[s] the welkin crack,
And casts a flash of lightning to 200 the earth:
But, ere I march to wealthy Persia,
Or leave Damascus and th' Egyptian fields,
As was the fame of Clymene's brain-sick son
That almost brent 201 the axle-tree of heaven,
So shall our swords, our lances, and our shot
Fill all the air with fiery meteors;
Then, when the sky shall wax as red as blood,
It shall be said I made it red myself,
To make me think of naught but blood and war.

ZABINA. Unworthy king, that by thy cruelty
Unlawfully usurp'st the Persian seat,
Dar'st thou, that never saw an emperor
Before thou met my husband in the field,
Being thy captive, thus abuse his state,
Keeping his kingly body in a cage,
That roofs of gold and sun-bright palaces
Should have prepar'd to entertain his grace?
And treading him beneath thy loathsome feet,
Whose feet the kings 202 of Africa have kiss'd?

TECHELLES. You must devise some torment worse, my lord,
To make these captives rein their lavish tongues.

TAMBURLAINE. Zenocrate, look better to your slave.

ZENOCRATE. She is my handmaid's slave, and she shall look
That these abuses flow not from 203 her tongue.—
Chide her, Anippe.

ANIPPE. Let these be warnings, then, for you, 204 my slave,
How you abuse the person of the king;
Or else I swear to have you whipt stark nak'd. 205

BAJAZETH. Great Tamburlaine, great in my overthrow,
Ambitious pride shall make thee fall as low,
For treading on the back of Bajazeth,
That should be horsed on four mighty kings.

TAMBURLAINE. Thy names, and titles, and thy dignities 206
Are fled from Bajazeth, and remain with me,
That will maintain it 'gainst a world of kings.—
Put him in again.

[They put him into the cage.]

BAJAZETH. Is this a place for mighty Bajazeth?
Confusion light on him that helps thee thus!

TAMBURLAINE. There, whiles 207 he lives, shall Bajazeth be kept;
And, where I go, be thus in triumph drawn;
And thou, his wife, shalt 208 feed him with the scraps
My servitors shall bring thee from my board;
For he that gives him other food than this,
Shall sit by him, and starve to death himself:
This is my mind, and I will have it so.
Not all the kings and emperors of the earth,
If they would lay their crowne before my feet,
Shall ransom him, or take him from his cage:
The ages that shall talk of Tamburlaine,
Even from this day to Plato's wondrous year,
Shall talk how I have handled Bajazeth:
These Moors, that drew him from Bithynia
To fair Damascus, where we now remain,
Shall lead him with us wheresoe'er we go.—
Techelles, and my loving followers,
Now may we see Damascus' lofty towers,
Like to the shadows of Pyramides
That with their beauties grace 209 the Memphian fields.
The golden stature 210 of their feather'd bird, 211
That spreads her wings upon the city-walls,
Shall not defend it from our battering shot:
The townsmen mask in silk and cloth of gold,
And every house is as a treasury;
The men, the treasure, and the town are 212 ours.

THERIDAMAS. Your tents of white now pitch'd before the gates,
And gentle flags of amity display'd,
I doubt not but the governor will yield,
Offering Damascus to your majesty.

TAMBURLAINE. So shall he have his life, and all the rest:
But, if he stay until the bloody flag
Be once advanc'd on my vermilion tent,
He dies, and those that kept us out so long;
And, when they see me march in black array,
With mournful streamers hanging down their heads,
Were in that city all the world contain'd,
Not one should scape, but perish by our swords.

ZENOCRATE. Yet would you have some pity for my sake,

"[TAMBURLAINE gets up on him into his chair.]

TAMBURLAINE. Now clear the triple region of the air,
And let the Majesty of Heaven behold
Their scourge and terror tread on emperors.
Smile, stars that reign'd at my nativity,
And dim the brightness of your 199 neighbour lamps;
Disdain to borrow light of Cynthia!
For I, the chiefest lamp of all the earth,
First rising in the east with mild aspect,
But fixed now in the meridian line,
Will send up fire to your turning spheres,
And cause the sun to borrow light of you.
My sword struck fire from his coat of steel,
Even in Bithynia, when I took this Turk;
As when a fiery exhalation,
Wrapt in the bowels of a freezing cloud,
Fighting for passage, make[s] the welkin crack,
And casts a flash of lightning to 200 the earth:
But, ere I march to wealthy Persia,
Or leave Damascus and th' Egyptian fields,
As was the fame of Clymene's brain-sick son
That almost brent 201 the axle-tree of heaven,
So shall our swords, our lances, and our shot
Fill all the air with fiery meteors;
Then, when the sky shall wax as red as blood,
It shall be said I made it red myself,
To make me think of naught but blood and war.

ZABINA. Unworthy king, that by thy cruelty
Unlawfully usurp'st the Persian seat,
Dar'st thou, that never saw an emperor
Before thou met my husband in the field,
Being thy captive, thus abuse his state,
Keeping his kingly body in a cage,
That roofs of gold and sun-bright palaces
Should have prepar'd to entertain his grace?
And treading him beneath thy loathsome feet,
Whose feet the kings 202 of Africa have kiss'd?

TECHELLES. You must devise some torment worse, my lord,
To make these captives rein their lavish tongues.

TAMBURLAINE. Zenocrate, look better to your slave.

ZENOCRATE. She is my handmaid's slave, and she shall look
That these abuses flow not from 203 her tongue.—
Chide her, Anippe.

ANIPPE. Let these be warnings, then, for you, 204 my slave,
How you abuse the person of the king;
Or else I swear to have you whipt stark nak'd. 205

BAJAZETH. Great Tamburlaine, great in my overthrow,
Ambitious pride shall make thee fall as low,
For treading on the back of Bajazeth,
That should be horsed on four mighty kings.

TAMBURLAINE. Thy names, and titles, and thy dignities 206
Are fled from Bajazeth, and remain with me,
That will maintain it 'gainst a world of kings.—
Put him in again.

[They put him into the cage.]

BAJAZETH. Is this a place for mighty Bajazeth?
Confusion light on him that helps thee thus!

TAMBURLAINE. There, whiles 207 he lives, shall Bajazeth be kept;
And, where I go, be thus in triumph drawn;
And thou, his wife, shalt 208 feed him with the scraps
My servitors shall bring thee from my board;
For he that gives him other food than this,
Shall sit by him, and starve to death himself:
This is my mind, and I will have it so.
Not all the kings and emperors of the earth,
If they would lay their crowne before my feet,
Shall ransom him, or take him from his cage:
The ages that shall talk of Tamburlaine,
Even from this day to Plato's wondrous year,
Shall talk how I have handled Bajazeth:
These Moors, that drew him from Bithynia
To fair Damascus, where we now remain,
Shall lead him with us wheresoe'er we go.—
Techelles, and my loving followers,
Now may we see Damascus' lofty towers,
Like to the shadows of Pyramides
That with their beauties grace 209 the Memphian fields.
The golden stature 210 of their feather'd bird, 211
That spreads her wings upon the city-walls,
Shall not defend it from our battering shot:
The townsmen mask in silk and cloth of gold,
And every house is as a treasury;
The men, the treasure, and the town are 212 ours.

THERIDAMAS. Your tents of white now pitch'd before the gates,
And gentle flags of amity display'd,
I doubt not but the governor will yield,
Offering Damascus to your majesty.

TAMBURLAINE. So shall he have his life, and all the rest:
But, if he stay until the bloody flag
Be once advanc'd on my vermilion tent,
He dies, and those that kept us out so long;
And, when they see me march in black array,
With mournful streamers hanging down their heads,
Were in that city all the world contain'd,
Not one should scape, but perish by our swords.

ZENOCRATE. Yet would you have some pity for my sake,
Because it is my country 213 and my father's.

"What dire offence from am'rous causes springs,
What mighty contests rise from trivial things,
I sing — This verse to Caryl, Muse! is due:
This, ev'n Belinda may vouchsafe to view:
Slight is the subject, but not so the praise,
If She inspire, and He approve my lays.

Say what strange motive, Goddess! could compel
A well-bred Lord t' assault a gentle Belle?
O say what stranger cause, yet unexplor'd,
Could make a gentle Belle reject a Lord?
In tasks so bold, can little men engage,
And in soft bosoms dwells such mighty Rage?

Sol thro' white curtains shot a tim'rous ray,
And oped those eyes that must eclipse the day:
Now lap-dogs give themselves the rousing shake,
And sleepless lovers, just at twelve, awake:
Thrice rung the bell, the slipper knock'd the ground,
And the press'd watch return'd a silver sound.
Belinda still her downy pillow prest,
Her guardian Sylph prolong'd the balmy rest:
'Twas He had summon'd to her silent bed
The morning-dream that hover'd o'er her head;
A Youth more glitt'ring than a Birth-night Beau,
(That ev'n in slumber caus'd her cheek to glow)
Seem'd to her ear his winning lips to lay,
And thus in whispers said, or seem'd to say.
Fairest of mortals, thou distinguish'd care
Of thousand bright Inhabitants of Air!
If e'er one vision touch.'d thy infant thought,
Of all the Nurse and all the Priest have taught;
Of airy Elves by moonlight shadows seen,
The silver token, and the circled green,
Or virgins visited by Angel-pow'rs,
With golden crowns and wreaths of heav'nly flow'rs;
Hear and believe! thy own importance know,
Nor bound thy narrow views to things below.
Some secret truths, from learned pride conceal'd,
To Maids alone and Children are reveal'd:
What tho' no credit doubting Wits may give?
The Fair and Innocent shall still believe.
Know, then, unnumber'd Spirits round thee fly,
The light Militia of the lower sky:
These, tho' unseen, are ever on the wing,
Hang o'er the Box, and hover round the Ring.
Think what an equipage thou hast in Air,
And view with scorn two Pages and a Chair.
As now your own, our beings were of old,
And once inclos'd in Woman's beauteous mould;
Thence, by a soft transition, we repair
From earthly Vehicles to these of air.
Think not, when Woman's transient breath is fled
That all her vanities at once are dead;
Succeeding vanities she still regards,
And tho' she plays no more, o'erlooks the cards.
Her joy in gilded Chariots, when alive,
And love of Ombre, after death survive.
For when the Fair in all their pride expire,
To their first Elements their Souls retire:
The Sprites of fiery Termagants in Flame
Mount up, and take a Salamander's name.
Soft yielding minds to Water glide away,
And sip, with Nymphs, their elemental Tea.
The graver Prude sinks downward to a Gnome,
In search of mischief still on Earth to roam.
The light Coquettes in Sylphs aloft repair,
And sport and flutter in the fields of Air.",,,GPT-4o,古文学,英文,"This passage depicts a narrative where a well-bred lord's romantic advances towards a lady, Belinda, lead to a series of trivial yet mighty events.

Slight is the subject, but not so the praise,
If She inspire, and He approve my lays.

Say what strange motive, Goddess! could compel
A well-bred Lord t' assault a gentle Belle?
O say what stranger cause, yet unexplor'd,
Could make a gentle Belle reject a Lord?
In tasks so bold, can little men engage,
And in soft bosoms dwells such mighty Rage?

Sol thro' white curtains shot a tim'rous ray,
And oped those eyes that must eclipse the day:
Now lap-dogs give themselves the rousing shake,
And sleepless lovers, just at twelve, awake:

Her guardian Sylph prolong'd the balmy rest:
'Twas He had summon'd to her silent bed
The morning-dream that hover'd o'er her head;
A Youth more glitt'ring than a Birth-night Beau,
(That ev'n in slumber caus'd her cheek to glow)
Seem'd to her ear his winning lips to lay,

The light Militia of the lower sky:

And view with scorn two Pages and a Chair.
As now your own, our beings were of old,
And once inclos'd in Woman's beauteous mould;
Thence, by a soft transition, we repair
From earthly Vehicles to these of air.
Think not, when Woman's transient breath is fled
That all her vanities at once are dead;
Succeeding vanities she still regards,
And tho' she plays no more, o'erlooks the cards.
Her joy in gilded Chariots, when alive,
And love of Ombre, after death survive.
For when the Fair in all their pride expire,
To their first Elements their Souls retire:
The Sprites of fiery Termagants in Flame
Mount up, and take a Salamander's name.
Soft yielding minds to Water glide away,
And sip, with Nymphs, their elemental Tea.

In search of mischief still on Earth to roam.

"May I for my own self song’s truth reckon,
Journey’s jargon, how I in harsh days
Hardship endured oft.
Bitter breast-cares have I abided,
Known on my keel many a care’s hold,
And dire sea-surge, and there I oft spent
Narrow nightwatch nigh the ship’s head
While she tossed close to cliffs. Coldly afflicted,
My feet were by frost benumbed.
Chill its chains are; chafing sighs
Hew my heart round and hunger begot
Mere-weary mood. Lest man know not
That he on dry land loveliest liveth,
List how I, care-wretched, on ice-cold sea,
Weathered the winter, wretched outcast
Deprived of my kinsmen;
Hung with hard ice-flakes, where hail-scur flew,
There I heard naught save the harsh sea
And ice-cold wave, at whiles the swan cries,
Did for my games the gannet’s clamour,
Sea-fowls, loudness was for me laughter,
The mews' singing all my mead-drink.
Storms, on the stone-cliffs beaten, fell on the stern
In icy feathers; full oft the eagle screamed
With spray on his pinion.
Not any protector
May make merry man faring needy.
This he little believes, who aye in winsome life
Abides ’mid burghers some heavy business,
Wealthy and wine-flushed, how I weary oft
Must bide above brine.
Neareth nightshade, snoweth from north,
Frost froze the land, hail fell on earth then
Corn of the coldest. Nathless there knocketh now
The heart's thought that I on high streams
The salt-wavy tumult traverse alone.
Moaneth alway my mind’s lust
That I fare forth, that I afar hence
Seek out a foreign fastness.
For this there’s no mood-lofty man over earth’s midst,
Not though he be given his good, but will have in his youth greed;
Nor his deed to the daring, nor his king to the faithful
But shall have his sorrow for sea-fare
Whatever his lord will.
He hath not heart for harping, nor in ring-having
Nor winsomeness to wife, nor world's delight
Nor any whit else save the wave's slash,
Yet longing comes upon him to fare forth on the water.
Bosque taketh blossom, cometh beauty of berries,
Fields to fairness, land fares brisker,
All this admonisheth man eager of mood,
The heart turns to travel so that he then thinks
On flood-ways to be far departing.
Cuckoo calleth with gloomy crying,
He singeth summerward, bodeth sorrow,
The bitter heart's blood. Burgher knows not —
He the prosperous man — what some perform
Where wandering them widest draweth.
So that but now my heart burst from my breast-lock,
My mood ’mid the mere-flood,
Over the whale’s acre, would wander wide.
On earth’s shelter cometh oft to me,
Eager and ready, the crying lone-flyer,
Whets for the whale-path the heart irresistibly,
O'er tracks of ocean; seeing that anyhow
My lord deems to me this dead life
On loan and on land, I believe not
That any earth-weal eternal standeth
Save there be somewhat calamitous
That, ere a man’s tide go, turn it to twain.
Disease or oldness or sword-hate
Beats out the breath from doom-gripped body.
And for this, every earl whatever, for those speaking after —
Laud of the living, boasteth some last word,
That he will work ere he pass onward,
Frame on the fair earth ’gainst foes his malice,
Daring ado, ...
So that all men shall honour him after
And his laud beyond them remain ’mid the English,
Aye, for ever, a lasting life’s-blast,
Delight mid the doughty.
Days little durable,
And all arrogance of earthen riches,
There come now no kings nor Cæsars
Nor gold-giving lords like those gone.
Howe’er in mirth most magnified,
Whoe’er lived in life most lordliest,
Drear all this excellence, delights undurable!
Waneth the watch, but the world holdeth.
Tomb hideth trouble. The blade is layed low.
Earthly glory ageth and seareth.
No man at all going the earth’s gait,
But age fares against him, his face paleth,
Grey-haired he groaneth, knows gone companions,
Lordly men are to earth o’ergiven,
Nor may he then the flesh-cover, whose life ceaseth,

"THESEUS.
Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
Another moon; but oh, methinks, how slow
This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires,
Like to a step-dame or a dowager,
Long withering out a young man’s revenue.
HIPPOLYTA.
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
And then the moon, like to a silver bow
New bent in heaven, shall behold the night
Of our solemnities.
THESEUS.
Go, Philostrate,
Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
Turn melancholy forth to funerals;
The pale companion is not for our pomp.
[Exit Philostrate.]
Hippolyta, I woo’d thee with my sword,
And won thy love doing thee injuries;
But I will wed thee in another key,
With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.
Enter Egeus, Hermia, Lysander and Demetrius.
EGEUS.
Happy be Theseus, our renownèd Duke!
THESEUS.
Thanks, good Egeus. What’s the news with thee?
EGEUS.
Full of vexation come I, with complaint
Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
This man hath my consent to marry her.
Stand forth, Lysander. And, my gracious Duke,
This man hath bewitch’d the bosom of my child.
Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
And interchang’d love-tokens with my child.
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
With feigning voice, verses of feigning love;
And stol’n the impression of her fantasy
With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits,
Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats (messengers
Of strong prevailment in unharden’d youth)
With cunning hast thou filch’d my daughter’s heart,
Turn’d her obedience (which is due to me)
To stubborn harshness. And, my gracious Duke,
Be it so she will not here before your grace
Consent to marry with Demetrius,
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens:
As she is mine I may dispose of her;
Which shall be either to this gentleman
Or to her death, according to our law
Immediately provided in that case.
THESEUS.
What say you, Hermia? Be advis’d, fair maid.
To you your father should be as a god;
One that compos’d your beauties, yea, and one
To whom you are but as a form in wax
By him imprinted, and within his power
To leave the figure, or disfigure it.
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
HERMIA.
So is Lysander.
THESEUS.
In himself he is.
But in this kind, wanting your father’s voice,
The other must be held the worthier.
HERMIA.
I would my father look’d but with my eyes.
THESEUS.
Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
HERMIA.
I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.
I know not by what power I am made bold,
Nor how it may concern my modesty
In such a presence here to plead my thoughts:
But I beseech your Grace that I may know
The worst that may befall me in this case,
If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
THESEUS.
Either to die the death, or to abjure
For ever the society of men.
Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,
Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
Whether, if you yield not to your father’s choice,
You can endure the livery of a nun,
For aye to be in shady cloister mew’d,
To live a barren sister all your life,
Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
Thrice-blessèd they that master so their blood
To undergo such maiden pilgrimage,
But earthlier happy is the rose distill’d
Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn,

Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
Another moon; but oh, methinks, how slow
This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires,
Like to a step-dame or a dowager,
Long withering out a young man’s revenue.

Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
And then the moon, like to a silver bow
New bent in heaven, shall behold the night
Of our solemnities.

Go, Philostrate,
Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
Turn melancholy forth to funerals;
The pale companion is not for our pomp.

Hippolyta, I woo’d thee with my sword,
And won thy love doing thee injuries;
But I will wed thee in another key,
With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.

EGEUS.
Happy be Theseus, our renownèd Duke!
THESEUS.
Thanks, good Egeus. What’s the news with thee?
EGEUS.
Full of vexation come I, with complaint
Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
This man hath my consent to marry her.
Stand forth, Lysander. And, my gracious Duke,
This man hath bewitch’d the bosom of my child.
Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
And interchang’d love-tokens with my child.
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
With feigning voice, verses of feigning love;
And stol’n the impression of her fantasy
With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits,
Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats (messengers
Of strong prevailment in unharden’d youth)
With cunning hast thou filch’d my daughter’s heart,
Turn’d her obedience (which is due to me)
To stubborn harshness. And, my gracious Duke,
Be it so she will not here before your grace
Consent to marry with Demetrius,
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens:
As she is mine I may dispose of her;
Which shall be either to this gentleman
Or to her death, according to our law
Immediately provided in that case.
THESEUS.
What say you, Hermia? Be advis’d, fair maid.
To you your father should be as a god;
One that compos’d your beauties, yea, and one
To whom you are but as a form in wax
By him imprinted, and within his power
To leave the figure, or disfigure it.
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
HERMIA.
So is Lysander.
THESEUS.
In himself he is.
But in this kind, wanting your father’s voice,
The other must be held the worthier.
HERMIA.
I would my father look’d but with my eyes.
THESEUS.

HERMIA.
I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.

Nor how it may concern my modesty
In such a presence here to plead my thoughts:
But I beseech your Grace that I may know
The worst that may befall me in this case,
If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
THESEUS.
Either to die the death, or to abjure
For ever the society of men.
Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,
Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
Whether, if you yield not to your father’s choice,
You can endure the livery of a nun,
For aye to be in shady cloister mew’d,
To live a barren sister all your life,
Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.

To undergo such maiden pilgrimage,
But earthlier happy is the rose distill’d

O god of love! I know he doth deserve
As much as may be yielded to a man;
But Nature never fram’d a woman’s heart
Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;

Values itself so highly, that to her

Deserve as full as fortunate a bed
As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?
HERO.
O god of love! I know he doth deserve
As much as may be yielded to a man;
But Nature never fram’d a woman’s heart
Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
Misprising what they look on, and her wit
Values itself so highly, that to her
All matter else seems weak. She cannot love,
Nor take no shape nor project of affection,
She is so self-endear’d.
URSULA.
Sure I think so;
And therefore certainly it were not good
She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.
HERO.
Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,
How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featur’d,
But she would spell him backward: if fair-fac’d,
She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;
If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antick,
Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;
If low, an agate very vilely cut;
If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
If silent, why, a block moved with none.
So turns she every man the wrong side out,
And never gives to truth and virtue that
Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.
URSULA.
Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.
HERO.
No; not to be so odd, and from all fashions,
As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable.
But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,
She would mock me into air: O! she would laugh me
Out of myself, press me to death with wit.
Therefore let Benedick, like cover’d fire,
Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:
It were a better death than die with mocks,
Which is as bad as die with tickling.
URSULA.
Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.
HERO.
No; rather I will go to Benedick,
And counsel him to fight against his passion.
And, truly, I’ll devise some honest slanders
To stain my cousin with. One doth not know
How much an ill word may empoison liking.",,,GPT-4o,古文学,英文,"In this passage from 'Much Ado About Nothing,' Hero and Ursula discuss Beatrice's disdainful and proud nature while they try to trick her into believing that Benedick is in love with her. They note that Beatrice would mock any man, no matter his qualities. Fearing Beatrice's mockery, Hero decides it is better to counsel Benedick to suppress his feelings rather than tell Beatrice about his love. Ultimately, they plan to spread false rumors to make Benedick lose interest in Beatrice.",526

Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,
Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:
Arise, I say.
BRABANTIO.
What, have you lost your wits?
RODERIGO.
Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?
BRABANTIO.
Not I. What are you?
RODERIGO.
My name is Roderigo.
BRABANTIO.
The worser welcome.
I have charg’d thee not to haunt about my doors;
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
My daughter is not for thee; and now in madness,
Being full of supper and distempering draughts,
Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come
To start my quiet.
RODERIGO.
Sir, sir, sir,—
BRABANTIO.
But thou must needs be sure
My spirit and my place have in them power
To make this bitter to thee.
RODERIGO.
Patience, good sir.
BRABANTIO.
What tell’st thou me of robbing?
This is Venice. My house is not a grange.
RODERIGO.
Most grave Brabantio,
In simple and pure soul I come to you.
IAGO.
Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God if the devil bid you. Because we come to do you service, and you think we are ruffians, you’ll have your daughter cover’d with a Barbary horse; you’ll have your nephews neigh to you; you’ll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.
BRABANTIO.
What profane wretch art thou?
IAGO.
I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.
BRABANTIO.
Thou art a villain.
IAGO.
You are a senator.
BRABANTIO.
This thou shalt answer. I know thee, Roderigo.
RODERIGO.
Sir, I will answer anything. But I beseech you,
If ’t be your pleasure, and most wise consent,
(As partly I find it is) that your fair daughter,
At this odd-even and dull watch o’ the night,
Transported with no worse nor better guard,
But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor:
If this be known to you, and your allowance,
We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs.
But if you know not this, my manners tell me,
We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe
That from the sense of all civility,
I thus would play and trifle with your reverence.
Your daughter (if you have not given her leave)
I say again, hath made a gross revolt,
Tying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes
In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
Of here and everywhere. Straight satisfy yourself:
If she be in her chamber or your house,
Let loose on me the justice of the state
For thus deluding you.
BRABANTIO.
Strike on the tinder, ho!
Give me a taper! Call up all my people!
This accident is not unlike my dream,
Belief of it oppresses me already.
Light, I say, light!",,,GPT-4o,古文学,英文,"Brabantio is awakened in the middle of the night by Roderigo and Iago, who inform him that his daughter Desdemona has eloped with Othello, a Moor. Initially skeptical and dismissive, Brabantio becomes alarmed upon hearing the detailed accusations and decides to verify the claim by checking on Desdemona himself. The news deeply disturbs Brabantio, as the accusation aligns with a troubling dream he had.",533
"When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye
the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.
For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not
always.
For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did
it for my burial.
Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.

Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,

And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.

And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.

Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the
disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that
we prepare for thee to eat the passover?
And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him,
The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover
at thy house with my disciples.
And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.

40:026:020 Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.

And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one
of you shall betray me.
And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them
to say unto him, Lord, is it I?
And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in
the dish, the same shall betray me.
The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.

Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.

And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.

And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,
saying, Drink ye all of it;
For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for
many for the remission of sins.
But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.

And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.

Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.

But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.

Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be
offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.
Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night,
before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I
not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.
Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.

And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and
began to be sorrowful and very heavy.
Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even
unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.
And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.

And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and
saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?
Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit
indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.

And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were
heavy.
And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third
time, saying the same words.
Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.

And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.

Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever
I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.
And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and
kissed him.
And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then
came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.
And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out
his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high
priest's, and smote off his ear.
Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his
place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the
sword.
Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he
shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?
But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?
In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.

But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.",,,GPT-4o,古文学,英文,"In this passage, Jesus acknowledges a woman's act of anointing him with ointment as preparation for his burial and states that her deed will be remembered wherever the gospel is preached.

"孔子去见老子，老子刚洗了头，正披散着头发晾干，那木然的样子，简直不像是一个活着的人。孔子躲在一个地方耐心地等待着，过了一会儿，二人会面，孔子说：“是我眼花，还是真的呢？刚才先生的身体，挺立着一动不动的样子简直就像是一段干木头似的，那全神贯注的样子，好像是把天地万物都忘得一干二净，只剩下了您所思考的问题。”

老聃说：“我在天地万物的起源问题神游，进入了深沌虚无的境界。”

孔子说：“这是什么意思呢？”

老聃说：“心里对这个问题感到十分的困惑，发现它不是人所能理解的，嘴张开想说点什么，却不知道从何说起。试着给你谈一下它的大略吧！地之极致为阴冷之气，天之极致是炎热之气，阴冷之气虽在地上却植根于天上，炎热之气虽在天上却植根于地上，两者相互交流贯通和合，这就生成了万物，或许有某个统领这一切的纲纪存在，但我们却看不到它的形体。消亡又生息，盈满又空虚，一暗一明，日变月化，每时每刻都有所作为，我们却不知道它是怎么样起作用的。万物的出生应该有一个萌发的地方，亏物死亡也应该有一个归宿，开始和终结是相反的，我们却不知道它们的开端在哪里，也不知道它们结束在什么地方。可是如果没有这样的事物存在，那么这个世界该是由谁来作为它的主宰呢？”

孔子说：“请问，您神游大道的情形是什么样的呢？”

老聃说：“如果到了这样的境界，那真是无比的美妙和无比的快乐。在无比美妙的境界中享受最伟大的快乐，这就可以称之为最崇高的人了。”

孔子说：“请问，怎么样才能达到最美妙最快乐的境界呢？”

老聃说：“食草的兽类，不担忧更换沼泽地；水生的虫类，不担忧变换水是在什么地方。因为那都是些小的变化而并没有失去基本的生活条件，所以，喜怒哀乐的心情就不会随着小的变化而在心中引起激荡。天下这块地方，是万物共同生息的场所。既然万事万物都有着共同的生存背景，那么我们的四肢百体即便早晚将成为一堆垃圾，由于生和死、终和始也将和昼夜交替一样地循环不止，谁也无法打乱这一循环性的自然秩序，我们也就不和对它太介意。如果连生死都能不介意，何况人生那一点得和失、祸和福之间的斤斤计较呢！所有隶属于自己的身外之物都和得失祸福连在一起，所以对于它们，完全可以像丢弃泥土一样弃之不顾，因为我们懂得我们的身体比那些隶属于此身的东西要更加珍贵些。如果懂得了自身存在的珍贵，也就不会为一些小的变故而患失了。而且世界的千变万化是无穷无尽的，又何必这么一个无限性的问题而弄得自己心神不宁呢！已经明白了大道的这种属性的人是可以对这个问题释怀的。”

孔子说：“先生对天地万物已以有了如此高明的理解，而且还借助最准确的言说来提高自己的修养和心理素质。古来的君子，谁又能超过您呢！”

老聃说：“话不能这样说。水的清明澄澈，是在无所作为的情况下才会如此；最高境界的人的德行，并不是修养得来的，因为万事万物事实上根本无法也不可能离开道的范围。就像天自然就高，地自然就厚，日月自然就明亮一样，哪里需要像我这般来修养啊！”

老聃说：“食草的兽类，不担忧更换沼泽地；水生的虫类，不担忧变换水是在什么地方。因为那都是些小的变化而并没有失去基本的生活条件，所以，喜怒哀乐的心情就不会随着小的变化而在心中引起激荡。天下这块地方，是万物共同生息的场所。既然万事万物都有着共同的生存背景，那么我们的四肢百体即便早晚将成为一堆垃圾，由于生和死、终和始也将和昼夜交替一样地循环不止，谁也无法打乱这一循环性的自然秩序，我们也就不和对它太介意。如果连生死都能不介意，何况人生那一点得和失、祸和福之间的斤斤计较呢！所有隶属于自己的身外之物都和得失祸福连在一起，所以对于它们，完全可以像丢弃泥土一样弃之不顾，因为我们懂得我们的身体比那些隶属于此身的东西要更加珍贵些。如果懂得了自身存在的珍贵，也就不会为一些小的变故而患失了。而且世界的千变万化是无穷无尽的，又何必这么一个无限性的问题而弄得自己心神不宁呢！已经明白了大道的这种属性的人是可以对这个问题释怀的。”

孔子说：“先生对天地万物已以有了如此高明的理解，而且还借助最准确的言说来提高自己的修养和心理素质。古来的君子，谁又能超过您呢！”

老聃说：“话不能这样说。水的清明澄澈，是在无所作为的情况下才会如此；最高境界的人的德行，并不是修养得来的，因为万事万物事实上根本无法也不可能离开道的范围。就像天自然就高，地自然就厚，日月自然就明亮一样，哪里需要像我这般来修养啊！”

孔子出来，把这些告诉了颜回，他说：“我对于道的认识，就如同醋坛中的飞虫一样，太渺小了！如果没有先生启发我，抹掉我蒙蔽在心头的糊涂想法，我就不会知道天地全备的道理！”",,,GPT-4o,哲学,中文,孔子拜访老子，见到老子在深思天地万物的起源问题，并感受到一种进入深沌虚无的境界。老子解释了万物生成、消亡的自然循环以及如何达到心境平和的最高境界，即不为生死、得失、祸福所扰。老子认为真正的智慧和德行是自然无为的结果，而不是刻意修养而来。孔子听后深有感触，认为自己对道的理解过于渺小，感激老子的启发。,1318
"孔子去见老子，老子刚洗了头，正披散着头发晾干，那木然的样子，简直不像是一个活着的人。孔子躲在一个地方耐心地等待着，过了一会儿，二人会面，孔子说：“是我眼花，还是真的呢？刚才先生的身体，挺立着一动不动的样子简直就像是一段干木头似的，那全神贯注的样子，好像是把天地万物都忘得一干二净，只剩下了您所思考的问题。”

老聃说：“我在天地万物的起源问题神游，进入了深沌虚无的境界。”

孔子说：“这是什么意思呢？”

老聃说：“心里对这个问题感到十分的困惑，发现它不是人所能理解的，嘴张开想说点什么，却不知道从何说起。试着给你谈一下它的大略吧！地之极致为阴冷之气，天之极致是炎热之气，阴冷之气虽在地上却植根于天上，炎热之气虽在天上却植根于地上，两者相互交流贯通和合，这就生成了万物，或许有某个统领这一切的纲纪存在，但我们却看不到它的形体。消亡又生息，盈满又空虚，一暗一明，日变月化，每时每刻都有所作为，我们却不知道它是怎么样起作用的。万物的出生应该有一个萌发的地方，亏物死亡也应该有一个归宿，开始和终结是相反的，我们却不知道它们的开端在哪里，也不知道它们结束在什么地方。可是如果没有这样的事物存在，那么这个世界该是由谁来作为它的主宰呢？”

孔子说：“请问，您神游大道的情形是什么样的呢？”

老聃说：“如果到了这样的境界，那真是无比的美妙和无比的快乐。在无比美妙的境界中享受最伟大的快乐，这就可以称之为最崇高的人了。”

孔子说：“请问，怎么样才能达到最美妙最快乐的境界呢？”

"孟子说：“君子和一般人不同的地方，就在于居心不同。君子心里老惦记着仁，老惦记着礼。仁人爱他人，有礼的人尊敬他人。爱他人的人，别人总是爱他；尊敬他人的人，别人总是尊敬他。假如这里有个人，他对待我蛮横无礼，那君子一定反躬自问：我一定不够仁，一定不够有礼，不然，这种态度怎么会来呢？反躬自问后仍然觉得，我实在仁，实在有礼，那人的蛮横无礼还是原样，君子一定又反躬自问：我一定不够忠心。反躬自问后仍然觉得，我实在忠心耿耿，那人的蛮横无礼还是原样，君子就会说：‘这不过是个妄人罢了，这样不讲理，那和禽兽有什么区别呢？对于禽兽又有什么好责备的呢？’

“所以君子有长期的忧患，却没有突发的忧患。但是，下面这样的忧虑是有的：舜是人，我也是人。舜为天下人所效法，能流芳百世，我却仍然不免是个普通人。这个才是值得忧虑的事。有了忧虑怎么办呢？尽力向舜学习罢了。至于君子的别的忧患，可是没有的。不是仁义的事不干，不合礼节的事不做。即使有突发的忧患，君子也不以为痛苦了。”",,,GPT-4o,哲学,中文,孟子认为君子和一般人的区别在于内心是否长存仁义与礼仪。君子总是爱人尊人，因此别人也会爱他和尊敬他。遇到别人无礼时，君子会反思自身是否不够仁义或忠心，最终发现只是对方无理，不必责备。君子有长期的忧虑在于自我提升，追求成为像舜那样的圣人，而不会为突发事件感到痛苦。,424

"人在小孩的时候，父母抚养他很马虎，孩子长大以后要埋怨父母；孩子壮年时期，供养父母微薄，父母就恼怒责备他。儿子和父母是血肉至亲，但有时责骂有时埋怨，都是因为各自怀着相互依赖的心理而认为对方不能周到地照顾自己。雇用雇工来播种耕耘，主人花费家财准备好的饮食，挑选布币交换钱币来付报酬，不是喜欢雇工，而是说：像这样做，雇工耕地将会深耕，锄草才会精细。雇工尽力而快速地耕田耕地，使尽技巧整理畦埂，不是因为喜爱主人，而是说：像这样做，饭菜才会丰盛，钱币将会容易得到。主人这样供养雇工而爱惜功力，有父亲和儿子之间的惠泽，而雇工专心一意地为主人工作，都是怀着为自己打算的心理。所以人们办事和给人好处，如果从对自己有利着想，那么关系疏远的人也容易和好；从对自己有害处着想，那么父子之间也要分离而且埋怨。

曾子又说：“学生很冒昧地向老师请教，圣人的德行，就没有比孝道更大的吗？”孔子说：“天地所生的万物，最尊贵的是人。人的德行，没有比孝道更大的了。孝道之中，没有比把父亲推到最尊严的地位更大的了。要把父亲推到最尊严的地位，没有比请父亲的神明来配同上天享受祭祀更大的了，而周公就是这样的人。昔日，周公在郊外祭祀其先祖后稷，以他配同上天；在明堂宗庙祭祀文王，以他配同上帝。所以，天下的诸侯都带贡品前来助祭。因此说圣人的德行，哪有比孝道更大的呢？”子女对于父母的亲爱之情，产生于在父母膝下嬉戏的幼年时期；日后就以这种亲爱之情奉养父母，一天比一天地更加尊敬父母。“圣人根据人们对父母的敬畏之心，教导人们懂得礼敬；根据人们对父母的亲近之心，教导人们懂得仁爱。所以圣人的教化，不须用严肃的方式就能成功，其政令不须用严厉的手段推行就能使天下太平。这是由于圣人所依据的是孝道这个根本。父子之间的慈孝之道是天性，它表现在君臣之间就是大义。父母生子，继承宗嗣之事，让孝道得以相续，没有比这种人伦关系更重大的了！父亲既有君的尊严，又有父的慈爱，让儿女的孝心得以培养，没有比这种恩义更厚重的了！所以，不爱自己的父母，而去爱别人，那就叫违背道德；不尊敬自己的父母，而去尊敬他人，那就叫违背礼义。君主应当顺乎天性，敬爱父母，如果违逆天性，不孝父母，老百姓就会无以仿效啊！君主不能尽孝，违背道德礼法，国家必会招致灾难，即使这样能得崇高的权位，君子也不以为贵了。作为君子，绝不做违背道德礼法之事。君子说话前，必会考虑其言语是否可说；行动前，必会考虑其行为是否能让大众悦服；建立品德，做事合乎正义，可以值得尊敬；所作所为，可以值得效法；仪容举止，遵守礼法，可以值得观摩；一举一动，合乎法度，可以值得赞叹。君子以这些威仪对待百姓，百姓就会敬畏他而且爱戴他，以他作为学习的榜样。因此，君子能实现道德教化，从而畅行其政策命令。《诗经·曹风·鸤鸠》说：‘一个善人君子，他的德行威仪，没有任何欠缺。’”,,,GPT-4o,哲学,中文,这段文字讲述了曾子向孔子请教圣人的德行是否有比孝道更大的。孔子解释说，人的德行中没有比孝道更大的，尤其是尊敬父亲。周公就是尊敬先祖和父亲的典范。圣人的教化是通过孝道来实现的，无需严厉手段，能使天下太平。孝道是人伦关系的重要基础，不爱尊敬父母就违背道德和礼义。君主应尽孝道，以身作则，才能让国家安定。君子的言行举止要合乎礼法，可以作为百姓的榜样，促进道德教化。,826

"孙子说：大凡兴兵十万，出征千里，百姓的耗费，国家的开支，每天至少耗资千金；国家内外动荡，民夫兵卒因往来奔波而疲惫不堪，不能安心从事耕作的人多达七十万家。这样相持多年就是为了争求有朝一日的胜利。如果最后却因吝惜爵禄和金钱，不肯用来重用间谍，以致不能掌握敌情而失败，那就是不仁到极点啊。这样的人不配做军队的统帅，不配做国君的辅臣，也不可能取得最后的胜利。英明的国君、贤能的将帅，之所以动辄就能战胜敌人，功业超越众人，就在于用兵作战之前便掌握了敌情。要事先了解敌情，决不能乞求鬼神的启示，也不能用相似的例子作类比推测，更不能从日月星辰运行的数理去验证，而只能从那些真正熟悉敌情的人那里去获取。

间谍的运用方式有“因间”“内间”“反间”“死间”“生间”五种。五种间谍一齐使用，使敌人无从捉摸我用间的规律，这就是使用间谍神妙莫测的方法，也正是国君克敌制胜的法宝。所谓“因间”，是利用敌国居民中的普通人做间谍；所谓“内间”，是指利用敌方的官员做我方的间谍；所谓“反间”，就是利用敌方派来的间谍，使之反过来为我效力；所谓“死间”，是指制造散布虚假情报，通过我方间谍将假情报传给敌间，诱使敌人上当。但事情一旦败露，这类间谍难免一死而被称为死间；所谓“生间”，是指能亲自活着回来报告敌情的间谍。

因此，对于统领三军、用兵打仗的国君和主将来说，三军之中没有比间谍更值得信赖的人了，军中的奖赏没有比奖赏间谍更优厚的了，军中的机密也没有比使用间谍更为机密的了。不是英明睿智的人不能任用间谍，不是仁义的人不能驱使间谍，不是谋虑精细的人不能分析判断间谍提供的情报真实性。微妙呀，微妙！在作战过程中无时无处不可以使用间谍。如果间谍工作还没有进行就泄露了用间的消息，那么，间谍和了解内情的人都要被处死。

对于敌人派来的刺探我方情报的敌方间谍，也必须把他们搜查出来，之后再用优厚的待遇和金钱来收买他们，对他们进行引诱开导，再放他们回去，这样就可以使他们成为反间，为我所用了。通过反间了解敌情，就能培植、利用因间和内间了；同样，根据反间提供的情报，就能让死间传播假情报给敌人了；由于从反间那里了解了敌情，避开了危险，生间也就可如期回报。这五种间谍的情况，君主都必须了解掌握，而了解情况的关键在于利用反间，所以对反间不可不给予优厚待遇。

"漠北大草原，野马动成群。啊，自由的象征！
史前时代，是我们的祖先有求于马，而马无求于人。马与人曾经互不相识，真正平等。
快蹄跑雪踏坚冰，厚毛抗风御寒冷。适应辽阔荒凉的环境，是马的天性。
渴了自寻甜泉喝，饿了自觅茂草啃。喜欢独立自在的生存，是马的天性。
翘起后腿尥蹶子，踢偷咬的豺狗，踢追捕的猎人。爱和平，是马的天性。
马群告别故乡，被卖进城，看见高楼大厦，非常吃惊。母马嘶叫：“天啦，里面居然住人！”公马喷鼻：“但愿这里不住我们。”
与人类的相识，乃马类的不幸。一旦被相马权威伯乐先生看中，检验合格，便是马最大的不幸。伯乐通知马主人：“牵那畜牲来受训。”从此开始苦难的历程。
二、悲哉，人类之马
训练班的总教练是伯乐，姓孙，名阳，又名伯乐，以马师的身份侍候爱马的秦穆公。其实伯乐是一个群体的共名，哪个时代都有，哪个国家都有，可以姓张李王，赵钱孙。他对人说，“鄙人的特长是整治畜牲。”他对马说：“朋友，我了解你。你们谁优谁劣，谁纯谁杂，谁千里谁豆腐，我一眼能看出来。请信任我，同我愉快合作。”那些好出风头的马见他走来，都很激动，引颈长嘶。
训练课程可分两个阶段。
第一阶段，烙烧杂毛，理鬃剪鬣，修脚钉掌，火印打号，安笼头，衔嚼铁，系缰绳，又用皮带捆扎背部、胸部、腋部、腹部、臀部，再拖进马棚内，关入糟枥，押上栈床，其事甚烦。有一些天性倔强的马，受不了一连串的厚爱，或咬或踢，怙恶不悛，遂被拉到屠场，宰了卖肉。第一阶段结束，十有二三之马被杀。
第二阶段，耐饥考验，饿毙一批，耐渴考验，又渴死一批。测试高速长跑能力，倒毙一批。突然加速，说是培养爆发力，又累死一批。整顿作风，淘汰自由散漫分子。统一步调，清洗离心离德分子。这两类被叫做害群之马，当场屠了示众。第二阶段结束，十有五六之马已呜呼了。
伯乐训练班能卒业的马仅有小部分，均获毕业证，被称为良骏。因其毛色互异，赐以嘉名，例如骅、骝、骢、（马因）、（马辛）、骓、骐、骠、骝、骊，都很好听。可怜这些骏马，口中嚼铁横卡，压疼舌根硌疼牙，缰绳一拉，勒痛嘴巴，全身绊绊挂挂，从颈项周围到肛门上下，屁股还要挨鞭打，说不出的尴尬，天性完全抹杀。自然之马，悲哉，被改造成人类之马！
岂但整治马匹，人间七十二行，行行都有伯乐先生。陶匠说：“鄙人的特长是整治粘土，捏造陶器，圆的溜圆，方的正方。不信请用圆规比比，矩尺量量。”木匠说：“鄙人的特长是整治木料，打造木器，曲的正曲：直的笔直，不信请用曲线板比比，直尺量量。”伯乐何其多呀！
马师强奸马意，还以为马应该谢他的恩。似乎马喜欢被整治，被勒，被鞭。
陶匠强奸土意，还以为土应该谢的他恩。似乎土喜欢被整治，被捏成方圆。
木匠强奸木意，还以为木应该谢他的恩。似乎木喜欢被整治，被曲，被直。
有谁尊重马的天性，土的天性，木的天性，为马呼吁，为土呼吁，为木呼吁。我只听见一片激赏之声，说孙马师本领高，说张陶匠技艺强，说李木匠工夫好。
七十二行之外，还有国王。
国王强奸民意，还以为百姓应该谢他的恩。似乎大家喜欢被整治，被管，被奴。他永远不晓得自己有什么错，正如七十二行大大小小的伯乐，洋洋得意，死不觉悟。当然，我说的是坏国王。",,,GPT-4o,哲学,中文,这段文字通过描述马匹在自由生活和被人类驯化后的悲惨命运，揭示了人类强行改造自然和其他生物，甚至同类的行为。它批判了人为破坏自然法则和本性，将这种行为扩展到对土、木以及人的压迫，表达了对自然天性的尊重和对人为强制行为的谴责。作者通过对比自由的马群和被驯化的马匹，深刻批判了人类文明对其他生命的强加和控制。,1280

"漠北大草原，野马动成群。啊，自由的象征！
史前时代，是我们的祖先有求于马，而马无求于人。马与人曾经互不相识，真正平等。
快蹄跑雪踏坚冰，厚毛抗风御寒冷。适应辽阔荒凉的环境，是马的天性。
渴了自寻甜泉喝，饿了自觅茂草啃。喜欢独立自在的生存，是马的天性。
翘起后腿尥蹶子，踢偷咬的豺狗，踢追捕的猎人。爱和平，是马的天性。
马群告别故乡，被卖进城，看见高楼大厦，非常吃惊。母马嘶叫：“天啦，里面居然住人！”公马喷鼻：“但愿这里不住我们。”
与人类的相识，乃马类的不幸。一旦被相马权威伯乐先生看中，检验合格，便是马最大的不幸。伯乐通知马主人：“牵那畜牲来受训。”从此开始苦难的历程。
二、悲哉，人类之马
训练班的总教练是伯乐，姓孙，名阳，又名伯乐，以马师的身份侍候爱马的秦穆公。其实伯乐是一个群体的共名，哪个时代都有，哪个国家都有，可以姓张李王，赵钱孙。他对人说，“鄙人的特长是整治畜牲。”他对马说：“朋友，我了解你。你们谁优谁劣，谁纯谁杂，谁千里谁豆腐，我一眼能看出来。请信任我，同我愉快合作。”那些好出风头的马见他走来，都很激动，引颈长嘶。
训练课程可分两个阶段。
第一阶段，烙烧杂毛，理鬃剪鬣，修脚钉掌，火印打号，安笼头，衔嚼铁，系缰绳，又用皮带捆扎背部、胸部、腋部、腹部、臀部，再拖进马棚内，关入糟枥，押上栈床，其事甚烦。有一些天性倔强的马，受不了一连串的厚爱，或咬或踢，怙恶不悛，遂被拉到屠场，宰了卖肉。第一阶段结束，十有二三之马被杀。
第二阶段，耐饥考验，饿毙一批，耐渴考验，又渴死一批。测试高速长跑能力，倒毙一批。突然加速，说是培养爆发力，又累死一批。整顿作风，淘汰自由散漫分子。统一步调，清洗离心离德分子。这两类被叫做害群之马，当场屠了示众。第二阶段结束，十有五六之马已呜呼了。

周穆王时，最西方的国家有个能幻化的人来到中国，他能进入水火之中，穿过金属岩石，能翻倒山河，移动城市，悬在空中不会坠落，碰到实物不被阻碍，千变万化，无穷无尽，既能改变事物的形状，又能改变人的思虑。穆王对他像天神一样的尊敬，像国君一样的侍奉，把自己的寝宫让出来让他居住，用祭把神灵的膳食给他吃喝，选择美丽的女子乐队供他娱乐。可是这个幻化人却认为穆王的宫殿太低太差不可以居住，穆王的膳食又腥又臭不可以享用，穆王的嫔妃又羶又丑不可以亲近。于是穆王便为他另筑宫殿，土木建筑、雕梁画栋，以至于到了不能再巧妙的程度。穆王把府库的钱财全部耗尽，才把楼台建成。楼台高达八千尺，比终南山还要高，称作中天之台，挑选郑国和卫国美丽而苗条的女子，体洒香水，修饰娥眉，戴上首饰耳环，穿上东阿的细布，拖上齐国的绢绸，涂脂抹粉，描眉画唇，佩珠玉，戴手镯，再带上各种香草去充满这座楼台，演奏《承云》、《六莹》、《九韶》、《晨露》等动听的音乐使他快乐，每月送去最美的衣服，每天送上最美的膳食。可是那位幻化人还不高兴，不得已才进去。没住多久，他邀请穆王一同出去游玩。穆王拉着他的衣袖，便腾云而上，到天的中央才停下来。接着便到了幻化人的宫殿。幻化人的宫殿用金银建筑，以珠玉装饰，在白云与雷雨之上，不知道它下面以什么为依托，看上去好像是屯留在白云之中。耳朵听到的，眼睛看到的，鼻子闻到的，口舌尝到的，都是人间所没有的东西。穆王真以为到了清都、紫微、钧天、广乐这些天帝所居住的地方。穆王低下头往地面上看去，见自己的宫殿楼台简直像累起来的上块和堆起来的茅草。穆王自己觉得即使在这里住上几十年也不会想念自己的国家的。幻化人又请穆王一同游玩。所到之处，抬头看不见太阳月亮，低头看不见江河海洋。光影照来，穆王眼花缭乱看不清楚；音响传来，穆王耳鸣声乱听不明白。百骸六脏，全都颤抖而不能平静。意志昏迷，精神丧失，于是请求幻化人带他回去。幻化人推了一把，穆王好像跌落到了虚空之中。醒来以后，还是坐在原来的地方，左右还是原来侍候他的人。看看眼前的东西，那水酒是刚倒出来的，菜肴是刚烧好的。穆王问左右：“我刚才是从哪里来的？”左右的人说：“大王不过是默默地待了一会儿。”从此穆王精神恍愧了三个月才恢复正常。再问幻化人。幻化人说：“我与大王的精神出去游玩罢了，形体何尝移动过呢？而且您在天上居住的宫殿，与大王的宫殿有什么不同呢？您在天上游玩的花园，与大王的花园有什么不同呢？大王习惯了经常看到的东西，对暂时的变化感到怀疑。其实即使是最大的变化，无论是慢一点的变化还是快一点的变化，哪能都如实地描绘出来呢？”穆王十分高兴，从此不过问国家大事，不亲近大臣与嫔妃，毫无顾忌地到遥远的地方去游玩，他下令用天下最好的八种骏马来驾车，右边的服马叫骅骝，左边的服马叫绿耳，右边的骏马叫赤骥，左边的骖马叫白牺。穆王的马车由造父驾驭，泰丙为车右。随从的马车，右边的服马叫渠黄，左边的服马叫踰轮，左边的骖马叫盗骊，右边的骏马叫山子，由柏夭主车，参百驾驭，奔戎为车右。驰驱了一千里，到了巨蒐氏的国家。巨蒐氏于是献上白鹄的血液供穆王饮用，准备牛马的乳汁给穆王洗脚，并供奉所有乘车与驾车的人。吃喝以后继续前进，又歇宿在崑山的弯曲处，赤水的北面。第二天便登上了崑 山巅，观览了黄帝的宫殿，并修缮整新，以传于后世。随后又成西王母的贵宾，在瑶池上宴饮。西王母为穆王朗诵歌谣，穆王也跟着唱和，歌辞都很悲哀。后来又观赏了太阳入山的情景，一天走了一万里。穆王于是叹道：“哎呀！我不修养道德而只知道享乐，后世的人恐怕要谴责我的罪过了吧！”穆王难道是神人吗？在一生中享尽了快乐，仍然活了一百岁才死，当时的人们还以为他升天了呢。,,,GPT-4o,哲学,中文,周穆王时期，一个能变幻莫测的人来到中国，展示了种种超凡能力，穆王对他尊敬有加，为其建造华美的宫殿。然而，幻化人对这些不满，带穆王体验了一次神奇的灵魂之旅。穆王在幻化人的帮助下，在天上看到了极为壮丽的景象，短时间内经历了极为丰富的感官体验，醒来后精神恍惚。此后，穆王不再关心国家事务，四处游历，游览了巨蒐氏的国家、崑山和黄帝的宫殿，还与西王母在瑶池上宴饮。最后，穆王自叹没有修养道德但享尽了快乐，活到一百岁才去世，人们认为他升天了。,1509

因此有些事情到四海之外去追求寻找却不能得到，有些则持守在身体之内却不能见效。所以贪多则反而获得少，看见大的反而所知甚少。人的五官七窍是精神的门窗，而气血则是五脏的使者。如果耳目沉溺在声色当中，那么五脏就会动荡不安。五脏动荡不安，那么血气就会激荡不休。血气激荡不休，那么精神就会驰骋在外而不能内守。精神驰骋在外不能持守，那么灾祸就会来临，即使祸大如山丘，你也没法感觉得到。所以，如果让耳目精明通畅而不受外界的诱惑、气志虚静恬愉而省却嗜欲、五脏安宁充盈而不外泄、精神持守于内心而不外越，那么即使是遥远的往事和未来的事情也不够你所认识的，更何况只是觉察眼前一些祸福之间的事情呢！所以说“精神逸出内心越远，所知道的就越少”。这就充分说明精神是不能外泄散逸的。所以，五色迷乱眼睛，使双目昏暗不明；五声哗乱耳朵，使双耳堵塞不聪；五味扰乱舌味，使口舌麻木无味；追逐名利而惑乱心性，使人行为放荡不羁。这四样东西，世间一般性的人是用来养生的，但实际上却是人生的累赘。所以说，嗜欲使人精气散逸，而爱憎之情则使人心力疲惫，假如不赶快清除它们，就会使人气血日耗殆尽。",,,GPT-4o,哲学,中文,这段文字讲述了宇宙从混沌状态中诞生阴阳二气互相作用产生万物，并详细阐述了人与天地自然的关系。强调人的精神源自上天，形骸源自大地，揭示了精神与形体的内在联系。同时，指出追求身外之物会损害内心精神，而保持精神内守则能使人心志清明，五脏安宁，避免灾祸侵扰。强调保持精神和气血的内守与恬静的重要性，警示嗜欲和情感过度会导致精气耗散，进而损害健康。,1662
"21. Were it necessary to add any FURTHER PROOF AGAINST THE EXISTENCE OF MATTER after what has been said, I could instance several of those errors and difficulties (not to mention impieties) which have sprung from that tenet. It has occasioned numberless controversies and disputes in philosophy, and not a few of far greater moment in religion. But I shall not enter into the detail of them in this place, as well because I think arguments A POSTERIORI are unnecessary for confirming what has been, if I mistake not, sufficiently demonstrated A PRIORI, as because I shall hereafter find occasion to speak somewhat of them.
22. I am afraid I have given cause to think I am needlessly prolix in handling this subject. For, to what purpose is it to dilate on that which may be demonstrated with the utmost evidence in a line or two, to any one that is capable of the least reflexion? It is but looking into your own thoughts, and so trying whether you can conceive it possible for a sound, or figure, or motion, or colour to exist without the mind or unperceived. This easy trial may perhaps make you see that what you contend for is a downright contradiction. Insomuch that I am content to put the whole upon this issue:--If you can but CONCEIVE it possible for one extended movable substance, or, in general, for any one idea, or anything like an idea, to exist otherwise than in a mind perceiving it, I shall readily give up the cause. And, as for all that COMPAGES of external bodies you contend for, I shall grant you its existence, THOUGH (1.) YOU CANNOT EITHER GIVE ME ANY REASON WHY YOU BELIEVE IT EXISTS [Vide sect. lviii.], OR (2.) ASSIGN ANY USE TO IT WHEN IT IS SUPPOSED TO EXIST [Vide sect. lx.]. I say, the bare possibility of your opinions being true shall pass for an argument that it is so. [Note: i.e. although your argument be deficient in the two requisites of an hypothesis.--Ed.]
23. But, say you, surely there is nothing easier than for me to imagine trees, for instance, in a park, or books existing in a closet, and nobody by to perceive them. I answer, you may so, there is no difficulty in it; but what is all this, I beseech you, more than framing in your mind certain ideas which you call BOOKS and TREES, and the same time omitting to frame the idea of any one that may perceive them? BUT DO NOT YOU YOURSELF PERCEIVE OR THINK OF THEM ALL THE WHILE? This therefore is nothing to the purpose; it only shows you have the power of imagining or forming ideas in your mind: but it does not show that you can conceive it possible the objects of your thought may exist without the mind. To make out this, IT IS NECESSARY THAT YOU CONCEIVE THEM EXISTING UNCONCEIVED OR UNTHOUGHT OF, WHICH IS A MANIFEST REPUGNANCY. When we do our utmost to conceive the existence of external bodies, we are all the while only contemplating our own ideas. But the mind taking no notice of itself, is deluded to think it can and does conceive bodies existing unthought of or without the mind, though at the same time they are apprehended by or exist in itself. A little attention will discover to any one the truth and evidence of what is here said, and make it unnecessary to insist on any other proofs against the existence of material substance.
24. THE ABSOLUTE EXISTENCE OF UNTHINKING THINGS ARE WORDS WITHOUT A MEANING.--It is very obvious, upon the least inquiry into our thoughts, to know whether it is possible for us to understand what is meant by the ABSOLUTE EXISTENCE OF SENSIBLE OBJECTS IN THEMSELVES, OR WITHOUT THE MIND. To me it is evident those words mark out either a direct contradiction, or else nothing at all. And to convince others of this, I know no readier or fairer way than to entreat they would calmly attend to their own thoughts; and if by this attention the emptiness or repugnancy of those expressions does appear, surely nothing more is requisite for the conviction. It is on this therefore that I insist, to wit, that the ABSOLUTE existence of unthinking things are words without a meaning, or which include a contradiction. This is what I repeat and inculcate, and earnestly recommend to the attentive thoughts of the reader.
25. THIRD ARGUMENT.[Note: Vide sect. iii. and vii.]--REFUTATION OF LOCKE.--All our ideas, sensations, notions, or the things which we perceive, by whatsoever names they may be distinguished, are visibly inactive--there is nothing of power or agency included in them. So that ONE IDEA or object of thought CANNOT PRODUCE or make ANY ALTERATION IN ANOTHER. To be satisfied of the truth of this, there is nothing else requisite but a bare observation of our ideas. For, since they and every part of them exist only in the mind, it follows that there is nothing in them but what is perceived: but whoever shall attend to his ideas, whether of sense or reflexion, will not perceive in them any power or activity; there is, therefore, no such thing contained in them. A little attention will discover to us that the very being of an idea implies passiveness and inertness in it, insomuch that it is impossible for an idea to do anything, or, strictly speaking, to be the cause of anything: neither can it be the resemblance or pattern of any active being, as is evident from sect. 8. Whence it plainly follows that extension, figure, and motion cannot be the cause of our sensations. To say, therefore, that these are the effects of powers resulting from the configuration, number, motion, and size of corpuscles, must certainly be false. [Note: Vide sect. cii.]
26. CAUSE OF IDEAS.--We perceive a continual succession of ideas, some are anew excited, others are changed or totally disappear. There is therefore some cause of these ideas, whereon they depend, and which produces and changes them. That this cause cannot be any quality or idea or combination of ideas, is clear from the preceding section. It must therefore be a substance; but it has been shown that there is no corporeal or material substance: it remains therefore that the CAUSE OF IDEAS is an incorporeal active substance or Spirit.
27. NO IDEA OF SPIRIT.--A spirit is one simple, undivided, active being--as it perceives ideas it is called the UNDERSTANDING, and as it produces or otherwise operates about them it is called the WILL. Hence there can be no idea formed of a soul or spirit; for all ideas whatever, being passive and inert (vide sect. 25), they cannot represent unto us, by way of image or LIKENESS, that which acts. A little attention will make it plain to any one, that to have an idea which shall be like that active principle of motion and change of ideas is absolutely impossible. Such is the nature of SPIRIT, or that which acts, that it cannot be of itself perceived, BUT ONLY BY THE EFFECTS WHICH IT PRODUCETH. If any man shall doubt of the truth of what is here delivered, let him but reflect and try if he can frame the idea of any power or active being, and whether he has ideas of two principal powers, marked by the names WILL and UNDERSTANDING, distinct from each other as well as from a third idea of Substance or Being in general, with a relative notion of its supporting or being the subject of the aforesaid powers--which is signified by the name SOUL or SPIRIT. This is what some hold; but, so far as I can see, the words WILL [Note: ""Understanding, mind.""--Edit 1710.], SOUL, SPIRIT, do not stand for different ideas, or, in truth, for any idea at all, but for something which is very different from ideas, and which, being an agent, cannot be like unto, or represented by, any idea whatsoever. Though it must be owned at the same time that we have some notion of soul, spirit, and the operations of the mind: such as willing, loving, hating--inasmuch as we know or understand the meaning of these words.
28. I find I can excite ideas in my mind at pleasure, and vary and shift the scene as oft as I think fit. It is no more than willing, and straightway this or that idea arises in my fancy; and by the same power it is obliterated and makes way for another. This making and unmaking of ideas doth very properly denominate the mind active. Thus much is certain and grounded on experience; but when we think of unthinking agents or of exciting ideas exclusive of volition, we only amuse ourselves with words.
29. IDEAS OF SENSATION DIFFER FROM THOSE OF REFLECTION OR MEMORY.--But, whatever power I may have over MY OWN thoughts, I find the ideas actually perceived by Sense have not a like dependence on my will. When in broad daylight I open my eyes, it is not in my power to choose whether I shall see or no, or to determine what particular objects shall present themselves to my view; and so likewise as to the hearing and other senses; the ideas imprinted on them are not creatures of my will. There is THEREFORE SOME OTHER WILL OR SPIRIT that PRODUCES THEM.
30. LAWS OF NATURE.--The ideas of Sense are more strong, lively, and DISTINCT than those of the imagination; they have likewise a steadiness, order, and coherence, and are not excited at random, as those which are the effects of human wills often are, but in a regular train or series, the admirable connexion whereof sufficiently testifies the wisdom and benevolence of its Author. Now THE SET RULES OR ESTABLISHED METHODS WHEREIN THE MIND WE DEPEND ON EXCITES IN US THE IDEAS OF SENSE, ARE CALLED THE LAWS OF NATURE; and these we learn by experience, which teaches us that such and such ideas are attended with such and such other ideas, in the ordinary course of things.",,,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage argues against the existence of material substance, stating that all perceived objects and ideas exist solely within the mind. The author challenges readers to conceive of any material object existing without being perceived, which he deems impossible and a contradiction. Furthermore, he refutes the notion of inanimate objects having power or agency, asserting instead that a spirit or mind is the cause of ideas and sensations. The argument dismantles the idea of unthinking substances existing independently, stating that such concepts are meaningless. The text concludes that while we can manipulate ideas within our own minds, sensory experiences occur independently of our will, thus indicating the presence of another will or spirit behind them. The established patterns by which we perceive sensory ideas are termed 'laws of nature,' showcasing the order and wisdom of a higher mind responsible for our sensory experiences.",1694

The text concludes that while we can manipulate ideas within our own minds, sensory experiences occur independently of our will, thus indicating the presence of another will or spirit behind them. The established patterns by which we perceive sensory ideas are termed 'laws of nature,' showcasing the order and wisdom of a higher mind responsible for our sensory experiences.",1694
"The idea of an object is an essential part of the belief of it, but not the whole. We conceive many things, which we do not believe. In order then to discover more fully the nature of belief, or the qualities of those ideas we assent to, let us weigh the following considerations.
It is evident, that all reasonings from causes or effects terminate in conclusions, concerning matter of fact; that is, concerning the existence of objects or of their qualities. It is also evident, that the idea, of existence is nothing different from the idea of any object, and that when after the simple conception of any thing we would conceive it as existent, we in reality make no addition to or alteration on our first idea. Thus when we affirm, that God is existent, we simply form the idea of such a being, as he is represented to us; nor is the existence, which we attribute to him, conceived by a particular idea, which we join to the idea of his other qualities, and can again separate and distinguish from them. But I go farther; and not content with asserting, that the conception of the existence of any object is no addition to the simple conception of it, I likewise maintain, that the belief of the existence joins no new ideas to those which compose the idea of the object. When I think of God, when I think of him as existent, and when I believe him to be existent, my idea of him neither encreases nor diminishes. But as it is certain there is a great difference betwixt the simple conception of the existence of an object, and the belief of it, and as this difference lies not in the parts or composition of the idea, which we conceive; it follows, that it must lie in the manner, in which we conceive it.
Suppose a person present with me, who advances propositions, to which I do not assent, that Caesar dyed in his bed, that silver is more fusible, than lead, or mercury heavier than gold; it is evident, that notwithstanding my incredulity, I clearly understand his meaning, and form all the same ideas, which he forms. My imagination is endowed with the same powers as his; nor is it possible for him to conceive any idea, which I cannot conceive; nor conjoin any, which I cannot conjoin. I therefore ask, Wherein consists the difference betwixt believing and disbelieving any proposition? The answer is easy with regard to propositions, that are proved by intuition or demonstration. In that case, the person, who assents, not only conceives the ideas according to the proposition, but is necessarily determined to conceive them in that particular manner, either immediately or by the interposition of other ideas. Whatever is absurd is unintelligible; nor is it possible for the imagination to conceive any thing contrary to a demonstration. But as in reasonings from causation, and concerning matters of fact, this absolute necessity cannot take place, and the imagination is free to conceive both sides of the question, I still ask, Wherein consists the deference betwixt incredulity and belief? since in both cases the conception of the idea is equally possible and requisite.
It will not be a satisfactory answer to say, that a person, who does not assent to a proposition you advance; after having conceived the object in the same manner with you; immediately conceives it in a different manner, and has different ideas of it. This answer is unsatisfactory; not because it contains any falshood, but because it discovers not all the truth. It is contest, that in all cases, wherein we dissent from any person, we conceive both sides of the question; but as we can believe only one, it evidently follows, that the belief must make some difference betwixt that conception to which we assent, and that from which we dissent. We may mingle, and unite, and separate, and confound, and vary our ideas in a hundred different ways; but until there appears some principle, which fixes one of these different situations, we have in reality no opinion: And this principle, as it plainly makes no addition to our precedent ideas, can only change the manner of our conceiving them.
All the perceptions of the mind are of two kinds, viz. impressions and ideas, which differ from each other only in their different degrees of force and vivacity. Our ideas are copyed from our impressions, and represent them in all their parts. When you would any way vary the idea of a particular object, you can only encrease or diminish its force and vivacity. If you make any other change on it, it represents a different object or impression. The case is the same as in colours. A particular shade of any colour may acquire a new degree of liveliness or brightness without any other variation. But when you produce any other variation, it is no longer the same shade or colour. So that as belief does nothing but vary the manner, in which we conceive any object, it can only bestow on our ideas an additional force and vivacity. An opinion, therefore, or belief may be most accurately defined, a lively idea related to or associated with a present impression.[6]
",,,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage discusses the nature of belief and the distinction between mere conception and belief in the existence of an object. It argues that while the conception of an object's existence does not add any new ideas to the object itself, belief differs in the manner of conception, characterized by an increased force and vivacity of ideas. The text considers scenarios of assent and dissent, illustrating that the difference between believing and not believing a proposition lies not in the ideas themselves but in how they are conceived.

"There is, in Dr. Tillotson's writings, an argument against the real presence, which is as concise, and elegant, and strong as any argument can possibly be supposed against a doctrine, so little worthy of a serious refutation. It is acknowledged on all hands, says that learned prelate, that the authority, either of the scripture or of tradition, is founded merely in the testimony of the apostles, who were eye-witnesses to those miracles of our Saviour, by which he proved his divine mission. Our evidence, then, for the truth of the Christian religion is less than the evidence for the truth of our senses; because, even in the first authors of our religion, it was no greater; and it is evident it must diminish in passing from them to their disciples; nor can any one rest such confidence in their testimony, as in the immediate object of his senses. But a weaker evidence can never destroy a stronger; and therefore, were the doctrine of the real presence ever so clearly revealed in scripture, it were directly contrary to the rules of just reasoning to give our assent to it. It contradicts sense, though both the scripture and tradition, on which it is supposed to be built, carry not such evidence with them as sense; when they are considered merely as external evidences, and are not brought home to every one's breast, by the immediate operation of the Holy Spirit.
Nothing is so convenient as a decisive argument of this kind, which must at least silence the most arrogant bigotry and superstition, and free us from their impertinent solicitations. I flatter myself, that I have discovered an argument of a like nature, which, if just, will, with the wise and learned, be an everlasting check to all kinds of superstitious delusion, and consequently, will be useful as long as the world endures. For so long, I presume, will the accounts of miracles and prodigies be found in all history, sacred and profane.
87.Though experience be our only guide in reasoning concerning matters of fact; it must be acknowledged, that this guide is not altogether infallible, but in some cases is apt to lead us into errors. One, who in our climate, should expect better weather in any week of June than in one of December, would reason justly, and conformably to experience; but it is certain, that he may happen, in the event, to find himself mistaken. However, we may observe, that, in such a case, he would have no cause to complain of experience; because it commonly informs us beforehand of the uncertainty, by that contrariety of events, which we may learn from a diligent observation. All effects follow not with like certainty from their supposed causes. Some events are found, in all countries and all ages, to have been constantly conjoined together: Others are found to have been more variable, and sometimes to disappoint our expectations; so that, in our reasonings concerning matter of fact, there are all imaginable degrees of assurance, from the highest certainty to the lowest species of moral evidence.
A wise man, therefore, proportions his belief to the evidence. In such conclusions as are founded on an infallible experience, he expects the event with the last degree of assurance, and regards his past experience as a full proof of the future existence of that event. In other cases, he proceeds with more caution: He weighs the opposite experiments: He considers which side is supported by the greater number of experiments: to that side he inclines, with doubt and hesitation; and when at last he fixes his judgement, the evidence exceeds not what we properly call probability. All probability, then, supposes an opposition of experiments and observations, where the one side is found to overbalance the other, and to produce a degree of evidence, proportioned to the superiority. A hundred instances or experiments on one side, and fifty on another, afford a doubtful expectation of any event; though a hundred uniform experiments, with only one that is contradictory, reasonably beget a pretty strong degree of assurance. In all cases, we must balance the opposite experiments, where they are opposite, and deduct the smaller number from the greater, in order to know the exact force of the superior evidence.
88.To apply these principles to a particular instance; we may observe, that there is no species of reasoning more common, more useful, and even necessary to human life, than that which is derived from the testimony of men, and the reports of eye-witnesses and spectators. This species of reasoning, perhaps, one may deny to be founded on the relation of cause and effect. I shall not dispute about a word. It will be sufficient to observe that our assurance in any argument of this kind is derived from no other principle than our observation of the veracity of human testimony, and of the usual conformity of facts to the reports of witnesses. It being a general maxim, that no objects have any discoverable connexion together, and that all the inferences, which we can draw from one to another, are founded merely on our experience of their constant and regular conjunction; it is evident, that we ought not to make an exception to this maxim in favour of human testimony, whose connexion with any event seems, in itself, as little necessary as any other. Were not the memory tenacious to a certain degree, had not men commonly an inclination to truth and a principle of probity; were they not sensible to shame, when detected in a falsehood: Were not these, I say, discovered by experience to be qualities, inherent in human nature, we should never repose the least confidence in human testimony. A man delirious, or noted for falsehood and villany, has no manner of authority with us.
And as the evidence, derived from witnesses and human testimony, is founded on past experience, so it varies with the experience, and is regarded either as a proof or a probability, according as the conjunction between any particular kind of report and any kind of object has been found to be constant or variable. There are a number of circumstances to be taken into consideration in all judgements of this kind; and the ultimate standard, by which we determine all disputes, that may arise concerning them, is always derived from experience and observation. Where this experience is not entirely uniform on any side, it is attended with an unavoidable contrariety in our judgements, and with the same opposition and mutual destruction of argument as in every other kind of evidence. We frequently hesitate concerning the reports of others. We balance the opposite circumstances, which cause any doubt or uncertainty; and when we discover a superiority on any side, we incline to it; but still with a diminution of assurance, in proportion to the force of its antagonist.
89.This contrariety of evidence, in the present case, may be derived from several different causes; from the opposition of contrary testimony; from the character or number of the witnesses; from the manner of their delivering their testimony; or from the union of all these circumstances. We entertain a suspicion concerning any matter of fact, when the witnesses contradict each other; when they are but few, or of a doubtful character; when they have an interest in what they affirm; when they deliver their testimony with hesitation, or on the contrary, with too violent asseverations. There are many other particulars of the same kind, which may diminish or destroy the force of any argument, derived from human testimony.
Suppose, for instance, that the fact, which the testimony endeavours to establish, partakes of the extraordinary and the marvellous; in that case, the evidence, resulting from the testimony, admits of a diminution, greater or less, in proportion as the fact is more or less unusual. The reason why we place any credit in witnesses and historians, is not derived from any connexion, which we perceive a priori, between testimony and reality, but because we are accustomed to find a conformity between them. But when the fact attested is such a one as has seldom fallen under our observation, here is a contest of two opposite experiences; of which the one destroys the other, as far as its force goes, and the superior can only operate on the mind by the force, which remains. The very same principle of experience, which gives us a certain degree of assurance in the testimony of witnesses, gives us also, in this case, another degree of assurance against the fact, which they endeavour to establish; from which contradition there necessarily arises a counterpoize, and mutual destruction of belief and authority.",,,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage examines the nature of evidence and belief, focusing on religious doctrines like the real presence, and the credibility of human testimony.

87.Though experience be our only guide in reasoning concerning matters of fact; it must be acknowledged, that this guide is not altogether infallible, but in some cases is apt to lead us into errors. One, who in our climate, should expect better weather in any week of June than in one of December, would reason justly, and conformably to experience; but it is certain, that he may happen, in the event, to find himself mistaken. However, we may observe, that, in such a case, he would have no cause to complain of experience; because it commonly informs us beforehand of the uncertainty, by that contrariety of events, which we may learn from a diligent observation. All effects follow not with like certainty from their supposed causes. Some events are found, in all countries and all ages, to have been constantly conjoined together: Others are found to have been more variable, and sometimes to disappoint our expectations; so that, in our reasonings concerning matter of fact, there are all imaginable degrees of assurance, from the highest certainty to the lowest species of moral evidence.
A wise man, therefore, proportions his belief to the evidence. In such conclusions as are founded on an infallible experience, he expects the event with the last degree of assurance, and regards his past experience as a full proof of the future existence of that event. In other cases, he proceeds with more caution: He weighs the opposite experiments: He considers which side is supported by the greater number of experiments: to that side he inclines, with doubt and hesitation; and when at last he fixes his judgement, the evidence exceeds not what we properly call probability. All probability, then, supposes an opposition of experiments and observations, where the one side is found to overbalance the other, and to produce a degree of evidence, proportioned to the superiority. A hundred instances or experiments on one side, and fifty on another, afford a doubtful expectation of any event; though a hundred uniform experiments, with only one that is contradictory, reasonably beget a pretty strong degree of assurance. In all cases, we must balance the opposite experiments, where they are opposite, and deduct the smaller number from the greater, in order to know the exact force of the superior evidence.
88.To apply these principles to a particular instance; we may observe, that there is no species of reasoning more common, more useful, and even necessary to human life, than that which is derived from the testimony of men, and the reports of eye-witnesses and spectators. This species of reasoning, perhaps, one may deny to be founded on the relation of cause and effect. I shall not dispute about a word. It will be sufficient to observe that our assurance in any argument of this kind is derived from no other principle than our observation of the veracity of human testimony, and of the usual conformity of facts to the reports of witnesses. It being a general maxim, that no objects have any discoverable connexion together, and that all the inferences, which we can draw from one to another, are founded merely on our experience of their constant and regular conjunction; it is evident, that we ought not to make an exception to this maxim in favour of human testimony, whose connexion with any event seems, in itself, as little necessary as any other. Were not the memory tenacious to a certain degree, had not men commonly an inclination to truth and a principle of probity; were they not sensible to shame, when detected in a falsehood: Were not these, I say, discovered by experience to be qualities, inherent in human nature, we should never repose the least confidence in human testimony. A man delirious, or noted for falsehood and villany, has no manner of authority with us.
And as the evidence, derived from witnesses and human testimony, is founded on past experience, so it varies with the experience, and is regarded either as a proof or a probability, according as the conjunction between any particular kind of report and any kind of object has been found to be constant or variable. There are a number of circumstances to be taken into consideration in all judgements of this kind; and the ultimate standard, by which we determine all disputes, that may arise concerning them, is always derived from experience and observation. Where this experience is not entirely uniform on any side, it is attended with an unavoidable contrariety in our judgements, and with the same opposition and mutual destruction of argument as in every other kind of evidence. We frequently hesitate concerning the reports of others. We balance the opposite circumstances, which cause any doubt or uncertainty; and when we discover a superiority on any side, we incline to it; but still with a diminution of assurance, in proportion to the force of its antagonist.
91.This contrariety of evidence, in the present case, may be derived from several different causes; from the opposition of contrary testimony; from the character or number of the witnesses; from the manner of their delivering their testimony; or from the union of all these circumstances. We entertain a suspicion concerning any matter of fact, when the witnesses contradict each other; when they are but few, or of a doubtful character; when they have an interest in what they affirm; when they deliver their testimony with hesitation, or on the contrary, with too violent asseverations. There are many other particulars of the same kind, which may diminish or destroy the force of any argument, derived from human testimony.
Suppose, for instance, that the fact, which the testimony endeavours to establish, partakes of the extraordinary and the marvellous; in that case, the evidence, resulting from the testimony, admits of a diminution, greater or less, in proportion as the fact is more or less unusual. The reason why we place any credit in witnesses and historians, is not derived from any connexion, which we perceive a priori, between testimony and reality, but because we are accustomed to find a conformity between them. But when the fact attested is such a one as has seldom fallen under our observation, here is a contest of two opposite experiences; of which the one destroys the other, as far as its force goes, and the superior can only operate on the mind by the force, which remains. The very same principle of experience, which gives us a certain degree of assurance in the testimony of witnesses, gives us also, in this case, another degree of assurance against the fact, which they endeavour to establish; from which contradition there necessarily arises a counterpoize, and mutual destruction of belief and authority.",,,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage examines the nature of evidence and belief, focusing on religious doctrines like the real presence, and the credibility of human testimony. Dr. Tillotson argues against the doctrine of real presence by asserting that our sensory evidence is stronger than scriptural or traditional evidence, which diminishes with transmission through generations. The text then explores how experience guides our reasoning about facts, noting its fallibility and variability. It details how a wise man proportions his belief to the evidence, weighing conflicting experiences and testimony. Human testimony's reliability is linked to the observed integrity and truthfulness of individuals. The passage also explains that extraordinary claims require stronger evidence, as our belief in testimony is based on the usual conformity between testimony and facts. When faced with unusual or marvelous claims, the same experience that supports belief in testimony also undermines belief in the extraordinary fact, leading to a balance where superior evidence prevails.",1447
"It will be best to prepare the ground for my thesis by a few very general remarks on the method of getting at scientific truth. It is a common platitude that a complete acquaintance with any one thing, however small, would require a knowledge of the entire universe. Not a sparrow falls to the ground but some of the remote conditions of his fall are to be found in the milky way, in our federal constitution, or in the early history of Europe. That is to say, alter the milky way, alter the federal constitution, alter the facts of our barbarian ancestry, and the universe would so far be a different universe from what it now is. One fact involved in the difference might be that the particular little street-boy who threw the stone which brought down the sparrow might not find himself opposite the sparrow at that particular moment; or, finding himself there, he might not be in that particular serene and disengaged mood of mind which expressed itself in throwing the stone. But, true as all this is, it would be very foolish for any one who {217}was inquiring the cause of the sparrow's fall to overlook the boy as too personal, proximate, and so to speak anthropomorphic an agent, and to say that the true cause is the federal constitution, the westward migration of the Celtic race, or the structure of the milky way. If we proceeded on that method, we might say with perfect legitimacy that a friend of ours, who had slipped on the ice upon his door-step and cracked his skull, some months after dining with thirteen at the table, died because of that ominous feast. I know, in fact, one such instance; and I might, if I chose, contend with perfect logical propriety that the slip on the ice was no real accident. ""There are no accidents,"" I might say, ""for science. The whole history of the world converged to produce that slip. If anything had been left out, the slip would not have occurred just there and then. To say it would is to deny the relations of cause and effect throughout the universe. The real cause of the death was not the slip, but the conditions which engendered the slip,—and among them his having sat at a table, six months previous, one among thirteen. That is truly the reason why he died within the year.""
It will soon be seen whose arguments I am, in form, reproducing here. I would fain lay down the truth without polemics or recrimination. But unfortunately we never fully grasp the import of any true statement until we have a clear notion of what the opposite untrue statement would be. The error is needed to set off the truth, much as a dark background is required for exhibiting the brightness of a picture. And the error which I am going to use as a foil to set off what seems to me the truth of my own statements is contained in the philosophy of Mr. Herbert Spencer and {218}his disciples. Our problem is, What are the causes that make communities change from generation to generation,—that make the England of Queen Anne so different from the England of Elizabeth, the Harvard College of to-day so different from that of thirty years ago?
I shall reply to this problem, The difference is due to the accumulated influences of individuals, of their examples, their initiatives, and their decisions. The Spencerian school replies, The changes are irrespective of persons, and independent of individual control. They are due to the environment, to the circumstances, the physical geography, the ancestral conditions, the increasing experience of outer relations; to everything, in fact, except the Grants and the Bismarcks, the Joneses and the Smiths.

Now, I say that these theorizers are guilty of precisely the same fallacy as he who should ascribe the death of his friend to the dinner with thirteen, or the fall of the sparrow to the milky way. Like the dog in the fable, who drops his real bone to snatch at its image, they drop the real causes to snatch at others, which from no possible human point of view are available or attainable. Their fallacy is a practical one. Let us see where it lies. Although I believe in free-will myself, I will waive that belief in this discussion, and assume with the Spencerians the predestination of all human actions. On that assumption I gladly allow that were the intelligence investigating the man's or the sparrow's death omniscient and omnipresent, able to take in the whole of time and space at a single glance, there would not be the slightest objection to the milky way or the fatal feast being {219}invoked among the sought-for causes. Such a divine intelligence would see instantaneously all the infinite lines of convergence towards a given result, and it would, moreover, see impartially: it would see the fatal feast to be as much a condition of the sparrow's death as of the man's; it would see the boy with the stone to be as much a condition of the man's fall as of the sparrow's.
The human mind, however, is constituted on an entirely different plan. It has no such power of universal intuition. Its finiteness obliges it to see but two or three things at a time. If it wishes to take wider sweeps it has to use 'general ideas,' as they are called, and in so doing to drop all concrete truths. Thus, in the present case, if we as men wish to feel the connection between the milky way and the boy and the dinner and the sparrow and the man's death, we can do so only by falling back on the enormous emptiness of what is called an abstract proposition. We must say, All things in the world are fatally predetermined, and hang together in the adamantine fixity of a system of natural law. But in the vagueness of this vast proposition we have lost all the concrete facts and links; and in all practical matters the concrete links are the only things of importance. The human mind is essentially partial. It can be efficient at all only by picking out what to attend to, and ignoring everything else,—by narrowing its point of view. Otherwise, what little strength it has is dispersed, and it loses its way altogether. Man always wants his curiosity gratified for a particular purpose. If, in the case of the sparrow, the purpose is punishment, it would be idiotic to wander off from the cats, boys, and other possible agencies close by in the street, to {220}survey the early Celts and the milky way: the boy would meanwhile escape. And if, in the case of the unfortunate man, we lose ourselves in contemplation of the thirteen-at-table mystery, and fail to notice the ice on the step and cover it with ashes, some other poor fellow, who never dined out in his life, may slip on it in coming to the door, and fall and break his head too.
It is, then, a necessity laid upon us as human beings to limit our view. In mathematics we know how this method of ignoring and neglecting quantities lying outside of a certain range has been adopted in the differential calculus. The calculator throws out all the 'infinitesimals' of the quantities he is considering. He treats them (under certain rules) as if they did not exist. In themselves they exist perfectly all the while; but they are as if they did not exist for the purposes of his calculation. Just so an astronomer, in dealing with the tidal movements of the ocean, takes no account of the waves made by the wind, or by the pressure of all the steamers which day and night are moving their thousands of tons upon its surface. Just so the marksman, in sighting his rifle, allows for the motion of the wind, but not for the equally real motion of the earth and solar system. Just so a business man's punctuality may overlook an error of five minutes, while a physicist, measuring the velocity of light, must count each thousandth of a second.
There are, in short, different cycles of operation in nature; different departments, so to speak, relatively independent of one another, so that what goes on at any moment in one may be compatible with almost any condition of things at the same time in the next. The mould on the biscuit in the store-room of a {221}man-of-war vegetates in absolute indifference to the nationality of the flag, the direction of the voyage, the weather, and the human dramas that may go on on board; and a mycologist may study it in complete abstraction from all these larger details. Only by so studying it, in fact, is there any chance of the mental concentration by which alone he may hope to learn something of its nature. On the other hand, the captain who in manoeuvring the vessel through a naval fight should think it necessary to bring the mouldy biscuit into his calculations would very likely lose the battle by reason of the excessive 'thoroughness' of his mind.
The causes which operate in these incommensurable cycles are connected with one another only if we take the whole universe into account. For all lesser points of view it is lawful—nay, more, it is for human wisdom necessary—to regard them as disconnected and irrelevant to one another.

With the moral symptoms of a changing temper there are perceptible changes in appearance. His countenance develops and takes the stamp of his character; the soft and sparse down upon his cheeks becomes darker and stiffer. His voice grows hoarse or rather he loses it altogether. He is neither a child nor a man and cannot speak like either of them. His eyes, those organs of the soul which till now were dumb, find speech and meaning; a kindling fire illumines them, there is still a sacred innocence in their ever brightening glance, but they have lost their first meaningless expression; he is already aware that they can say too much; he is beginning to learn to lower his eyes and blush, he is becoming sensitive, though he does not know what it is that he feels; he is uneasy without knowing why. All this may happen gradually and give you time enough; but if his keenness becomes impatience, his eagerness madness, if he is angry and sorry all in a moment, if he weeps without cause, if in the presence of objects which are beginning to be a source of danger his pulse quickens and his eyes sparkle, if he trembles when a woman’s hand touches his, if he is troubled or timid in her presence, O Ulysses, wise Ulysses! have a care! The passages you closed with so much pains are open; the winds are unloosed; keep your hand upon the helm or all is lost.
This is the second birth I spoke of; then it is that man really enters upon life; henceforth no human passion is a stranger to him. Our efforts so far have been child’s play, now they are of the greatest importance. This period when education is usually finished is just the time to begin; but to explain this new plan properly, let us take up our story where we left it.
Our passions are the chief means of self-preservation; to try to destroy them is therefore as absurd as it is useless; this would be to overcome nature, to reshape God’s handiwork. If God bade man annihilate the passions he has given him, God would bid him be and not be; He would contradict himself. He has never given such a foolish commandment, there is nothing like it written on the heart of man, and what God will have a man do, He does not leave to the words of another man. He speaks Himself; His words are written in the secret heart.
Now I consider those who would prevent the birth of the passions almost as foolish as those who would destroy them, and those who think this has been my object hitherto are greatly mistaken.
But should we reason rightly, if from the fact that passions are natural to man, we inferred that all the passions we feel in ourselves and behold in others are natural? Their source, indeed, is natural; but they have been swollen by a thousand other streams; they are a great river which is constantly growing, one in which we can scarcely find a single drop of the original stream. Our natural passions are few in number; they are the means to freedom, they tend to self-preservation. All those which enslave and destroy us have another source; nature does not bestow them on us; we seize on them in her despite.
The origin of our passions, the root and spring of all the rest, the only one which is born with man, which never leaves him as long as he lives, is self-love; this passion is primitive, instinctive, it precedes all the rest, which are in a sense only modifications of it. In this sense, if you like, they are all natural. But most of these modifications are the result of external influences, without which they would never occur, and such modifications, far from being advantageous to us, are harmful. They change the original purpose and work against its end; then it is that man finds himself outside nature and at strife with himself.
Self-love is always good, always in accordance with the order of nature. The preservation of our own life is specially entrusted to each one of us, and our first care is, and must be, to watch over our own life; and how can we continually watch over it, if we do not take the greatest interest in it?
Self-preservation requires, therefore, that we shall love ourselves; we must love ourselves above everything, and it follows directly from this that we love what contributes to our preservation. Every child becomes fond of its nurse; Romulus must have loved the she-wolf who suckled him. At first this attachment is quite unconscious; the individual is attracted to that which contributes to his welfare and repelled by that which is harmful; this is merely blind instinct. What transforms this instinct into feeling, the liking into love, the aversion into hatred, is the evident intention of helping or hurting us. We do not become passionately attached to objects without feeling, which only follow the direction given them; but those from which we expect benefit or injury from their internal disposition, from their will, those we see acting freely for or against us, inspire us with like feelings to those they exhibit towards us. Something does us good, we seek after it; but we love the person who does us good; something harms us and we shrink from it, but we hate the person who tries to hurt us.
The child’s first sentiment is self-love, his second, which is derived from it, is love of those about him; for in his present state of weakness he is only aware of people through the help and attention received from them. At first his affection for his nurse and his governess is mere habit. He seeks them because he needs them and because he is happy when they are there; it is rather perception than kindly feeling. It takes a long time to discover not merely that they are useful to him, but that they desire to be useful to him, and then it is that he begins to love them.
So a child is naturally disposed to kindly feeling because he sees that every one about him is inclined to help him, and from this experience he gets the habit of a kindly feeling towards his species; but with the expansion of his relations, his needs, his dependence, active or passive, the consciousness of his relations to others is awakened, and leads to the sense of duties and preferences. Then the child becomes masterful, jealous, deceitful, and vindictive. If he is not compelled to obedience, when he does not see the usefulness of what he is told to do, he attributes it to caprice, to an intention of tormenting him, and he rebels. If people give in to him, as soon as anything opposes him he regards it as rebellion, as a determination to resist him; he beats the chair or table for disobeying him. Self-love, which concerns itself only with ourselves, is content to satisfy our own needs; but selfishness, which is always comparing self with others, is never satisfied and never can be; for this feeling, which prefers ourselves to others, requires that they should prefer us to themselves, which is impossible. Thus the tender and gentle passions spring from self-love, while the hateful and angry passions spring from selfishness. So it is the fewness of his needs, the narrow limits within which he can compare himself with others, that makes a man really good; what makes him really bad is a multiplicity of needs and dependence on the opinions of others. It is easy to see how we can apply this principle and guide every passion of children and men towards good or evil. True, man cannot always live alone, and it will be hard therefore to remain good; and this difficulty will increase of necessity as his relations with others are extended. For this reason, above all, the dangers of social life demand that the necessary skill and care shall be devoted to guarding the human heart against the depravity which springs from fresh needs.
Man’s proper study is that of his relation to his environment. So long as he only knows that environment through his physical nature, he should study himself in relation to things; this is the business of his childhood; when he begins to be aware of his moral nature, he should study himself in relation to his fellow-men; this is the business of his whole life, and we have now reached the time when that study should be begun.",,,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage discusses the transformative period of adolescence marked by emotional and physical changes, indicating a transition from childhood to adulthood.

"The objective Mind is the absolute Idea, but only existing in posse: and as it is thus on the territory of finitude, its actual rationality retains the aspect of external apparency. The free will finds itself immediately confronted by differences which arise from the circumstance that freedom is its inward function and aim, and is in relation to an external and already subsisting objectivity, which splits up into different heads: viz. anthropological data (i.e. private and personal needs), external things of nature which exist for consciousness, and the ties of relation between individual wills which are conscious of their own diversity and particularity. These aspects constitute the external material for the embodiment of the will.
§ 484. But the purposive action of this will is to realise its concept, Liberty, in these externally-objective aspects, making the latter a world moulded by the former, which in it is thus at home with itself, locked together with it: the concept accordingly perfected to the Idea. Liberty, shaped into the actuality of a world, receives the form of Necessity the deeper substantial nexus of which is the system or organisation of the principles of liberty, whilst its phenomenal nexus is power or authority, [pg 104]and the sentiment of obedience awakened in consciousness.
§ 485. This unity of the rational will with the single will (this being the peculiar and immediate medium in which the former is actualised) constitutes the simple actuality of liberty. As it (and its content) belongs to thought, and is the virtual universal, the content has its right and true character only in the form of universality. When invested with this character for the intelligent consciousness, or instituted as an authoritative power, it is a Law150. When, on the other hand, the content is freed from the mixedness and fortuitousness, attaching to it in the practical feeling and in impulse, and is set and grafted in the individual will, not in the form of impulse, but in its universality, so as to become its habit, temper and character, it exists as manner and custom, or Usage151.
§ 486. This “reality,” in general, where free will has existence, is the Law (Right),—the term being taken in a comprehensive sense not merely as the limited juristic law, but as the actual body of all the conditions of freedom. These conditions, in relation to the subjective will, where they, being universal, ought to have and can only have their existence, are its Duties; whereas as its temper and habit they are Manners. What is a right is also a duty, and what is a duty, is also a right. For a mode of existence is a right, only as a consequence of the free substantial will: and the same content of fact, when referred to the will distinguished as subjective and individual, is a duty. It is the same content which the subjective consciousness recognises as a duty, and brings into existence in these several wills. The finitude of the objective will thus creates the semblance of a distinction between rights and duties.
[pg 105]
In the phenomenal range right and duty are correlata, at least in the sense that to a right on my part corresponds a duty in some one else. But, in the light of the concept, my right to a thing is not merely possession, but as possession by a person it is property, or legal possession, and it is a duty to possess things as property, i.e. to be as a person. Translated into the phenomenal relationship, viz. relation to another person—this grows into the duty of some one else to respect my right. In the morality of the conscience, duty in general is in me—a free subject—at the same time a right of my subjective will or disposition. But in this individualist moral sphere, there arises the division between what is only inward purpose (disposition or intention), which only has its being in me and is merely subjective duty, and the actualisation of that purpose: and with this division a contingency and imperfection which makes the inadequacy of mere individualistic morality. In social ethics these two parts have reached their truth, their absolute unity; although even right and duty return to one another and combine by means of certain adjustments and under the guise of necessity. The rights of the father of the family over its members are equally duties towards them; just as the children's duty of obedience is their right to be educated to the liberty of manhood. The penal judicature of a government, its rights of administration, &c., are no less its duties to punish, to administer, &c.; as the services of the members of the State in dues, military services, &c., are duties and yet their right to the protection of their private property and of the general substantial life in which they have their root. All the aims of society and the State are the private aim of the individuals. But the set of adjustments, by which their duties come back to them as the exercise and enjoyment of right, [pg 106]produces an appearance of diversity: and this diversity is increased by the variety of shapes which value assumes in the course of exchange, though it remains intrinsically the same. Still it holds fundamentally good that he who has no rights has no duties and vice versa.",,,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage discusses the relationship between the objective Mind, freedom, and external reality. It emphasizes that the free will aims to realize the concept of Liberty in external aspects, giving rise to a system of laws and customs that embody freedom. Rights and duties are correlated, as what is right for one person imposes duties on others, and vice versa. The passage elaborates how rights and duties coexist in social and legal contexts, emphasizing the unity of individual wills and the broader societal structure.

In social ethics these two parts have reached their truth, their absolute unity; although even right and duty return to one another and combine by means of certain adjustments and under the guise of necessity. The rights of the father of the family over its members are equally duties towards them; just as the children's duty of obedience is their right to be educated to the liberty of manhood. The penal judicature of a government, its rights of administration, &c., are no less its duties to punish, to administer, &c.; as the services of the members of the State in dues, military services, &c., are duties and yet their right to the protection of their private property and of the general substantial life in which they have their root. All the aims of society and the State are the private aim of the individuals.

"The objective Mind is the absolute Idea, but only existing in posse: and as it is thus on the territory of finitude, its actual rationality retains the aspect of external apparency. The free will finds itself immediately confronted by differences which arise from the circumstance that freedom is its inward function and aim, and is in relation to an external and already subsisting objectivity, which splits up into different heads: viz. anthropological data (i.e. private and personal needs), external things of nature which exist for consciousness, and the ties of relation between individual wills which are conscious of their own diversity and particularity. These aspects constitute the external material for the embodiment of the will.
§ 484. But the purposive action of this will is to realise its concept, Liberty, in these externally-objective aspects, making the latter a world moulded by the former, which in it is thus at home with itself, locked together with it: the concept accordingly perfected to the Idea. Liberty, shaped into the actuality of a world, receives the form of Necessity the deeper substantial nexus of which is the system or organisation of the principles of liberty, whilst its phenomenal nexus is power or authority, [pg 104]and the sentiment of obedience awakened in consciousness.
§ 485. This unity of the rational will with the single will (this being the peculiar and immediate medium in which the former is actualised) constitutes the simple actuality of liberty. As it (and its content) belongs to thought, and is the virtual universal, the content has its right and true character only in the form of universality. When invested with this character for the intelligent consciousness, or instituted as an authoritative power, it is a Law150. When, on the other hand, the content is freed from the mixedness and fortuitousness, attaching to it in the practical feeling and in impulse, and is set and grafted in the individual will, not in the form of impulse, but in its universality, so as to become its habit, temper and character, it exists as manner and custom, or Usage151.
§ 486. This “reality,” in general, where free will has existence, is the Law (Right),—the term being taken in a comprehensive sense not merely as the limited juristic law, but as the actual body of all the conditions of freedom. These conditions, in relation to the subjective will, where they, being universal, ought to have and can only have their existence, are its Duties; whereas as its temper and habit they are Manners. What is a right is also a duty, and what is a duty, is also a right. For a mode of existence is a right, only as a consequence of the free substantial will: and the same content of fact, when referred to the will distinguished as subjective and individual, is a duty. It is the same content which the subjective consciousness recognises as a duty, and brings into existence in these several wills. The finitude of the objective will thus creates the semblance of a distinction between rights and duties.
[pg 105]
In the phenomenal range right and duty are correlata, at least in the sense that to a right on my part corresponds a duty in some one else. But, in the light of the concept, my right to a thing is not merely possession, but as possession by a person it is property, or legal possession, and it is a duty to possess things as property, i.e. to be as a person. Translated into the phenomenal relationship, viz. relation to another person—this grows into the duty of some one else to respect my right. In the morality of the conscience, duty in general is in me—a free subject—at the same time a right of my subjective will or disposition. But in this individualist moral sphere, there arises the division between what is only inward purpose (disposition or intention), which only has its being in me and is merely subjective duty, and the actualisation of that purpose: and with this division a contingency and imperfection which makes the inadequacy of mere individualistic morality.

"In an earlier review of Kant's work (Werke, i. 83) on Glauben und Wissen (an article in Sendling and Hegel's Journal) Hegel attaches more weight to a factor in the critical theory of knowledge, here neglected. Kant, he says, has—[Pg 399]within the limits allowed by his psychological terms of thought—'put (in an excellent way) the à priori of sensibility into the original identity and multiplicity, and that as transcendental imagination in the ""higher power"" of an immersion of unity in multiplicity: whilst Understanding (Verstand) he makes to consist in the elevation to universality of this à priori synthetic unity of sensibility,—whereby this identity is invested with a comparative antithesis to the sensibility: and Reason (Vernunft) is presented as a still higher power over the preceding comparative antithesis, without however this universality and infinity being allowed to go beyond the stereotyped formal pure infinity. This genuinely rational construction by which, though the bad name ""faculties"" is left, there is in truth presented a single identity of them all, is transformed by Jacobi into a series of faculties, resting one upon another.'
P. 87, § 42. Fichte: cf. Werke, i. 420: 'I have said before, and say it here again, that my system is no other than the Kantian. That means: it contains the same view of facts, but in its method is quite independent of the Kantian exposition.' 'Kant, up to now, is a closed book.'—i. 442. There are two ways of critical idealism. 'Either' (as Fichte) 'it actually deduces from the fundamental laws of intelligence, that system of necessary modes of action, and with it, at the same time, the objective conceptions thus arising, and thus lets the whole compass of our conceptions gradually arise under the eyes of the reader or hearer; or' (like Kant and his unprogressive disciples) 'it gets hold of these laws from anywhere and anyhow, as they are immediately applied to objects, therefore on their lowest grade (—on this grade they are called categories), and then asseverates that it is by these that objects are determined and arranged.' And i. 478: 'I know that the categories which Kant laid down are in no way proved by him to be conditions of self-consciousness, but only said to be so: I know that space and time and what in the original consciousness is inseparable from them and fills them both, are still less deduced as such conditions, for of them it is not even said expressly—as of the categories—that they are so, but only inferentially. But I believe quite as surely that I know that Kant had the thought of such a system: that everything he actually propounds are fragments and results of this system; and that his statements have meaning and coherence only on this presupposition.'

I name it pure apperception ... or original apperception ... because it is that self-consciousness which can be accompanied by none further. The unity of it I also call the transcendental unity of self-consciousness, in order to denote the possibility of cognition à priori from it.'

P. 92, § 45. Reason and Understanding. In the Wolfian School (e.g. in Baumgarten's Metaphysik, § 468) the term intellect (Verstand) is used of the general faculty of higher cognition, while ratio (Vernunft) specially denotes the power of seeing distinctly the connexions of things. So Wolff (Vernünftige Gedanken von Gott, &c. § 277) defines Verstand as 'the faculty of distinctly representing the possible,' and Vernunft (§ 368) as 'the faculty of seeing into the connexion of truths.' It is on this use of Reason as the faculty of inference that Kant's use of the term is founded: though it soon widely departs from its origin. For upon the 'formal' use of reason as the faculty of syllogising, Kant superinduces a transcendental use as a 'faculty of principles,' while the understanding is only 'a faculty of rules.' 'Reason,' in other words, 'itself begets conceptions,' and 'maxims, which it borrows neither from the senses nor from the understanding.' (Kritik d. r. Vern., Dialektik, Einleit. ii. A.) And the essential aim of Reason is to give unity to the various cognitions of understanding. While the unity given by understanding is 'unity of a possible experience,' that sought by reason is the discovery of an unconditioned which will complete the unity of the former (Dial. Einleit. iv), or of 'the totality of the conditions to a given conditioned.' (Dial, vii.)
It is this distinction of the terms which is dominant in Fichte and Hegel, where Verstand is the more practical intellect which seeks definite and restricted results and knowledges, while Vernunft is a deeper and higher power which aims at completeness. In Goethe's more reflective prose we see illustrations of this usage: e.g. Wilh. Meister's Wanderjahre, i. it is said to be the object of the 'reasonable' man 'das entgegengesetzte zu überschauen[Pg 401] und in Uebereinstimmung zu bringen': or Bk. ii. Reasonable men when they have devised something verständig to get this or that difficulty out of the way, &c. Goethe, in his Sprüche in Prosa (896), Werke, iii. 281, says 'Reason has for its province the thing in process (das Werdende), understanding the thing completed (das Gewordene): the former does not trouble itself about the purpose, the latter asks not whence. Reason takes delight in developing; understanding wishes to keep everything as it is, so as to use it.' (Similarly in Eckermann's Convers. Feb. 13, 1829.) Cf. Oken, Naturphilosophie, § 2914. Verstand ist Microcosmus, Vernunft Macrocosmus.
Kant's use of the term Reason, coupled with his special view of Practical Reason and his use of the term Faith (Glaube), leads on to the terminology of Jacobi. In earlier writings Jacobi had insisted on the contrast between the superior authority of feeling and faith (which are in touch with truth) and the mechanical method of intelligence and reasoning (Verstand and Vernunft). At a later period however he changed and fixed the nomenclature of his distinction. What he had first called Glaube he latterly called Vernunft,—which is in brief a 'sense for the supersensible'—an intuition giving higher and complete or total knowledge—an immediate apprehension of the real and the true. As contrasted with this reasonable faith or feeling, he regards Verstand as a mere faculty of inference or derivative knowledge, referring one thing to another by the rule of identity.
This distinction which is substantially reproduced by Coleridge (though with certain clauses that show traces of Schellingian influence) has connexions—like so much else in Jacobi—with the usage of Schopenhauer, 'Nobody,' says Jacobi, 'has ever spoken of an animal Vernunft: a mere animal Verstand however we all know and speak of.' (Jacobi's Werke, iii. 8.) Schopenhauer repeats and enforces the remark. All animals possess, says Schopenhauer, the power of apprehending causality, of cognising objects: a power of immediate and intuitive knowledge of real things: this is Verstand. But Vernunft, which is peculiar to man, is the cognition of truth (not of reality): it is an abstract judgment with a sufficient reason (Welt als W. i. § 6).",,,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage explores various philosophical interpretations and distinctions related to Kant's theories, primarily focusing on the concepts of Reason (Vernunft) and Understanding (Verstand).

"(a) Time is not something which subsists of itself, or which inheres in things as an objective determination, and therefore remains, when abstraction is made of the subjective conditions of the intuition of things. For in the former case, it would be something real, yet without presenting to any power of perception any real object. In the latter case, as an order or determination inherent in things themselves, it could not be antecedent to things, as their condition, nor discerned or intuited by means of synthetical propositions à priori. But all this is quite possible when we regard time as merely the subjective condition under which all our intuitions take place. For in that case, this form of the inward intuition can be represented prior to the objects, and consequently à priori.
(b) Time is nothing else than the form of the internal sense, that is, of the intuitions of self and of our internal state. For time cannot be any determination of outward phenomena. It has to do neither with shape nor position; on the contrary, it determines the relation of representations in our internal state. And precisely because this internal intuition presents to us no shape or form, we endeavour to supply this want by analogies, and represent the course of time by a line progressing to infinity, the content of which constitutes a series which is only of one dimension; and we conclude from the properties of this line as to all the properties of time, with this single exception, that the parts of the line are coexistent, whilst those of time are successive. From this it is clear also that the representation of time is itself an intuition, because all its relations can be expressed in an external intuition.
(c) Time is the formal condition à priori of all phenomena whatsoever. Space, as the pure form of external intuition, is limited as a condition à priori to external phenomena alone. On the other hand, because all representations, whether they have or have not external things for their objects, still in themselves, as determinations of the mind, belong to our internal state; and because this internal state is subject to the formal condition of the internal intuition, that is, to time—time is a condition à priori of all phenomena whatsoever—the immediate condition of all internal, and thereby the mediate condition of all external phenomena. If I can say à priori, “All outward phenomena are in space, and determined à priori according to the relations of space,” I can also, from the principle of the internal sense, affirm universally, “All phenomena in general, that is, all objects of the senses, are in time and stand necessarily in relations of time.”
If we abstract our internal intuition of ourselves and all external intuitions, possible only by virtue of this internal intuition and presented to us by our faculty of representation, and consequently take objects as they are in themselves, then time is nothing. It is only of objective validity in regard to phenomena, because these are things which we regard as objects of our senses. It no longer objective we, make abstraction of the sensuousness of our intuition, in other words, of that mode of representation which is peculiar to us, and speak of things in general. Time is therefore merely a subjective condition of our (human) intuition (which is always sensuous, that is, so far as we are affected by objects), and in itself, independently of the mind or subject, is nothing. Nevertheless, in respect of all phenomena, consequently of all things which come within the sphere of our experience, it is necessarily objective. We cannot say, “All things are in time,” because in this conception of things in general, we abstract and make no mention of any sort of intuition of things. But this is the proper condition under which time belongs to our representation of objects. If we add the condition to the conception, and say, “All things, as phenomena, that is, objects of sensuous intuition, are in time,” then the proposition has its sound objective validity and universality à priori.
What we have now set forth teaches, therefore, the empirical reality of time; that is, its objective validity in reference to all objects which can ever be presented to our senses. And as our intuition is always sensuous, no object ever can be presented to us in experience, which does not come under the conditions of time. On the other hand, we deny to time all claim to absolute reality; that is, we deny that it, without having regard to the form of our sensuous intuition, absolutely inheres in things as a condition or property. Such properties as belong to objects as things in themselves never can be presented to us through the medium of the senses. Herein consists, therefore, the transcendental ideality of time, according to which, if we abstract the subjective conditions of sensuous intuition, it is nothing, and cannot be reckoned as subsisting or inhering in objects as things in themselves, independently of its relation to our intuition. This ideality, like that of space, is not to be proved or illustrated by fallacious analogies with sensations, for this reason—that in such arguments or illustrations, we make the presupposition that the phenomenon, in which such and such predicates inhere, has objective reality, while in this case we can only find such an objective reality as is itself empirical, that is, regards the object as a mere phenomenon. In reference to this subject, see the remark in Section I (§ 4)
",,,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage discusses the concept of time from a philosophical perspective. It argues that time is not an independent entity or an inherent property of objects, but rather a subjective condition of the internal sense through which humans perceive their own mental states and internal experiences. It contrasts this view with the idea of space, which is considered the form of external intuition and pertains to external phenomena. Time, as an internal intuition, determines the relations of internal representations and is necessary for all phenomena as experienced by humans. While time is empirically real in the context of human experience, it lacks absolute reality and does not inhere in objects independently of human perception. The passage emphasizes the transcendental ideality of time, meaning that its existence is contingent on the way humans intuitively perceive and represent objects.",927
"(a) Time is not something which subsists of itself, or which inheres in things as an objective determination, and therefore remains, when abstraction is made of the subjective conditions of the intuition of things. For in the former case, it would be something real, yet without presenting to any power of perception any real object. In the latter case, as an order or determination inherent in things themselves, it could not be antecedent to things, as their condition, nor discerned or intuited by means of synthetical propositions à priori. But all this is quite possible when we regard time as merely the subjective condition under which all our intuitions take place. For in that case, this form of the inward intuition can be represented prior to the objects, and consequently à priori.
(b) Time is nothing else than the form of the internal sense, that is, of the intuitions of self and of our internal state. For time cannot be any determination of outward phenomena. It has to do neither with shape nor position; on the contrary, it determines the relation of representations in our internal state. And precisely because this internal intuition presents to us no shape or form, we endeavour to supply this want by analogies, and represent the course of time by a line progressing to infinity, the content of which constitutes a series which is only of one dimension; and we conclude from the properties of this line as to all the properties of time, with this single exception, that the parts of the line are coexistent, whilst those of time are successive.

"(a) Physical perfection; that is, cultivation of all our faculties generally for the promotion of the ends set before us by reason. That this is a duty, and therefore an end in itself, and that the effort to effect this even without regard to the advantage that it secures us, is based, not on a conditional (pragmatic), but an unconditional (moral) imperative, may be seen from the following consideration. The power of proposing to ourselves an end is the characteristic of humanity (as distinguished from the brutes). With the end of humanity in our own person is therefore combined the rational will, and consequently the duty of deserving well of humanity by culture generally, by acquiring or advancing the power to carry out all sorts of possible ends, so far as this power is to be found in man; that is, it is a duty to cultivate the crude capacities of our nature, since it is by that cultivation that the animal is raised to man, therefore it is a duty in itself.
This duty, however, is merely ethical, that is, of indeterminate obligation. No principle of reason prescribes how far one must go in this effort (in enlarging or correcting his faculty of understanding, that is, in acquisition of knowledge or technical capacity); and besides the difference in the circumstances into which men may come makes the choice of the kind of employment for which he should cultivate his talent very arbitrary. Here, therefore, there is no law of reason for actions, but only for the maxim of actions, viz.: ""Cultivate thy faculties of mind and body so as to be effective for all ends that may come in thy way, uncertain which of them may become thy own.""
(b) Cultivation of Morality in ourselves. The greatest moral perfection of man is to do his duty, and that from duty (that the law be not only the rule but also the spring of his actions). Now at first sight this seems to be a strict obligation, and as if the principle of duty commanded not merely the legality of every action, but also the morality, i.e., the mental disposition, with the exactness and strictness of a law; but in fact the law commands even here only the maxim of the action, namely, that we should seek the ground of obligation, not in the sensible impulses (advantage or disadvantage), but wholly in the law; so that the action itself is not commanded. For it is not possible to man to see so far into the depth of his own heart that he could ever be thoroughly certain of the purity of his moral purpose and the sincerity of his mind even in one single action, although he has no doubt about the legality of it. Nay, often the weakness which deters a man from the risk of a crime is regarded by him as virtue (which gives the notion of strength). And how many there are who may have led a long blameless life, who are only fortunate in having escaped so many temptations. How much of the element of pure morality in their mental disposition may have belonged to each deed remains hidden even from themselves.
Accordingly, this duty to estimate the worth of one's actions not merely by their legality, but also by their morality (mental disposition), is only of indeterminate obligation; the law does not command this internal action in the human mind itself, but only the maxim of the action, namely, that we should strive with all our power that for all dutiful actions the thought of duty should be of itself an adequate spring.

"And thus, Glaucon, after the argument has gone a weary way, the true and the false philosophers have at length appeared in view.

I do not think, he said, that the way could have been shortened.

I suppose not, I said; and yet I believe that we might have had a better view of both of them if the discussion could have been confined to this one subject and if there were not many other questions awaiting us, which he who desires to see in what respect the life of the just differs from that of the unjust must consider.

And what is the next question? he asked.

Surely, I said, the one which follows next in order. Inasmuch as philosophers only are able to grasp the eternal and unchangeable, and those who wander in the region of the many and variable are not philosophers, I must ask you which of the two classes should be the rulers of our State?

And how can we rightly answer that question?

Whichever of the two are best able to guard the laws and institutions of our State—let them be our guardians.

Very good.

Neither, I said, can there be any question that the guardian who is to keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes?

There can be no question of that.

And are not those who are verily and indeed wanting in the knowledge of the true being of each thing, and who have in their souls no clear pattern, and are unable as with a painter’s eye to look at the absolute truth and to that original to repair, and having perfect vision of the other world to order the laws about beauty, goodness, justice in this, if not already ordered, and to guard and preserve the order of them—are not such persons, I ask, simply blind?

Truly, he replied, they are much in that condition.

And shall they be our guardians when there are others who, besides being their equals in experience and falling short of them in no particular of virtue, also know the very truth of each thing?

There can be no reason, he said, for rejecting those who have this greatest of all great qualities; they must always have the first place unless they fail in some other respect.

Suppose then, I said, that we determine how far they can unite this and the other excellences.

By all means.

In the first place, as we began by observing, the nature of the philosopher has to be ascertained. We must come to an understanding about him, and, when we have done so, then, if I am not mistaken, we shall also acknowledge that such an union of qualities is possible, and that those in whom they are united, and those only, should be rulers in the State.

What do you mean?

Let us suppose that philosophical minds always love knowledge of a sort which shows them the eternal nature not varying from generation and corruption.

Agreed.

And further, I said, let us agree that they are lovers of all true being; there is no part whether greater or less, or more or less honourable, which they are willing to renounce; as we said before of the lover and the man of ambition.

True.

And if they are to be what we were describing, is there not another quality which they should also possess?

What quality?

Truthfulness: they will never intentionally receive into their mind falsehood, which is their detestation, and they will love the truth.

Yes, that may be safely affirmed of them.

‘May be,’ my friend, I replied, is not the word; say rather ‘must be affirmed:’ for he whose nature is amorous of anything cannot help loving all that belongs or is akin to the object of his affections.

Right, he said.

And is there anything more akin to wisdom than truth?

How can there be?

Can the same nature be a lover of wisdom and a lover of falsehood?

Never.

The true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth, as far as in him lies, desire all truth?

Assuredly.

But then again, as we know by experience, he whose desires are strong in one direction will have them weaker in others; they will be like a stream which has been drawn off into another channel.

True.

He whose desires are drawn towards knowledge in every form will be absorbed in the pleasures of the soul, and will hardly feel bodily pleasure—I mean, if he be a true philosopher and not a sham one.

That is most certain.

Such an one is sure to be temperate and the reverse of covetous; for the motives which make another man desirous of having and spending, have no place in his character.

Very true.

Another criterion of the philosophical nature has also to be considered.

What is that?

There should be no secret corner of illiberality; nothing can be more antagonistic than meanness to a soul which is ever longing after the whole of things both divine and human.

Most true, he replied.

Then how can he who has magnificence of mind and is the spectator of all time and all existence, think much of human life?

He cannot.

Or can such an one account death fearful?

No indeed.

Then the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true philosophy?

Certainly not.

Or again: can he who is harmoniously constituted, who is not covetous or mean, or a boaster, or a coward—can he, I say, ever be unjust or hard in his dealings?

Impossible.

Then you will soon observe whether a man is just and gentle, or rude and unsociable; these are the signs which distinguish even in youth the philosophical nature from the unphilosophical.

True.

There is another point which should be remarked.

What point?

Whether he has or has not a pleasure in learning; for no one will love that which gives him pain, and in which after much toil he makes little progress.

Certainly not.

And again, if he is forgetful and retains nothing of what he learns, will he not be an empty vessel?

That is certain.

Labouring in vain, he must end in hating himself and his fruitless occupation? Yes.

Then a soul which forgets cannot be ranked among genuine philosophic natures; we must insist that the philosopher should have a good memory?

Certainly.

And once more, the inharmonious and unseemly nature can only tend to disproportion?

Undoubtedly.

And do you consider truth to be akin to proportion or to disproportion?

To proportion.

Then, besides other qualities, we must try to find a naturally well-proportioned and gracious mind, which will move spontaneously towards the true being of everything.

Certainly.

Well, and do not all these qualities, which we have been enumerating, go together, and are they not, in a manner, necessary to a soul, which is to have a full and perfect participation of being?

They are absolutely necessary, he replied.

And must not that be a blameless study which he only can pursue who has the gift of a good memory, and is quick to learn,—noble, gracious, the friend of truth, justice, courage, temperance, who are his kindred?

The god of jealousy himself, he said, could find no fault with such a study.",,,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"In this passage, the characters discuss the true nature of philosophers and their suitability as guardians of the State.

"But though this splenetic philosophy, which in time of sickness or low spirits is familiar to every man, thus entirely depreciates those great objects of human desire, when in better health and in better humour, we never fail to regard them under a more agreeable aspect. Our imagination, which in pain and sorrow seems to be confined and cooped up within our own persons, in times of ease and prosperity expands itself to every thing around us. We are then charmed with the beauty of that accommodation which reigns in the palaces and œconomy of the great; and admire how every thing is adapted to promote their ease, to prevent their wants, to gratify their wishes, and to amuse and entertain their most frivolous desires. If we consider the real satisfaction which all these things are capable of affording, by itself and separated from the beauty of that arrangement which is fitted to promote it, it will always appear in the highest 245degree contemptible and trifling. But we rarely view it in this abstract and philosophical light. We naturally confound it in our imagination with the order, the regular and harmonious movement of the system, the machine or œconomy by means of which it is produced.

"This formula shows us that the act of association comprises a mutual undertaking between the public and the individuals, and that each individual, in making a contract, as we may say, with himself, is bound in a double capacity; as a member of the Sovereign he is bound to the individuals, and as a member of the State to the Sovereign.

But the body politic or the Sovereign, drawing its being wholly from the sanctity of the contract, can never bind itself, even to an outsider, to do anything derogatory to the original act, for instance, to alienate any part of itself, or to submit to another Sovereign.

This, however, is not the case with the relation of the subjects to the Sovereign, which, despite the common interest, would have no security that they would fulfil their undertakings, unless it found means to assure itself of their fidelity.
In fact, each individual, as a man, may have a particular will contrary or dissimilar to the general will which he has as a citizen.

"The period which intervened between the birth of Pericles and the death of Aristotle, is undoubtedly, whether considered in itself, or with reference to the effects which it has produced upon the subsequent destinies of civilized man, the most memorable in the history of the world. What was the combination of moral and political circumstances which produced so unparalleled a progress during that period in literature and the arts;—why that progress, so rapid and so sustained, so soon received a check, and became retrograde,—are problems left to the wonder and conjecture of posterity. The wrecks and fragments of those subtle and profound minds, like the ruins of a fine statue, obscurely suggest to us the grandeur and perfection of the whole. Their very language—a type of the understandings of which it was the creation and the image—in variety, in simplicity, in flexibility, and in copiousness, excels every other language of the western world. Their sculptures are such as we, in our presumption, assume to be the models of ideal truth and beauty, and to which no artist of modern times can produce forms in any degree comparable. Their paintings, according to Pliny and Pausanias, were full of delicacy and harmony; and some even were powerfully pathetic, so as to awaken, like tender music or tragic poetry, the most overwhelming emotions. We are accustomed to conceive the painters of the sixteenth century, as those who have brought their art to the highest perfection, probably because none of the ancient paintings have been preserved. For all the inventive arts maintain, as it were, a sympathetic connexion between each other, being no more than various expressions of one internal power, modified by different circumstances, either of an individual, or of society; and the paintings of that period would probably bear the same relation as is confessedly borne by the sculptures to all succeeding ones. Of their music we know little; but the effects which it is said to have produced, whether they be attributed to the skill of the composer, or the sensibility of his audience, are far more powerful than any which we experience from the music of our own times; and if, indeed, the melody of their compositions were more tender and delicate, and inspiring, than the melodies of some modern European nations, their superiority in this art must have been something wonderful, and wholly beyond conception.
Their poetry seems to maintain a very high, though not so disproportionate a rank, in the comparison. Perhaps Shakespeare, from the variety and comprehension of his genius, is to be considered, on the whole, as the greatest individual mind, of which we have specimens remaining. Perhaps Dante created imaginations of greater loveliness and energy than any that are to be found in the ancient literature of Greece. Perhaps nothing has been discovered in the fragments of the Greek lyric poets equivalent to the sublime and chivalric sensibility of Petrarch.—But, as a poet. Homer must be acknowledged to excel Shakespeare in the truth, the harmony, the sustained grandeur, the satisfying completeness of his images, their exact fitness to the illustration, and to that to which they belong. Nor could Dante, deficient in conduct, plan, nature, variety, and temperance, have been brought into comparison with these men, but for those fortunate isles laden with golden fruit, which alone could tempt any one to embark in the misty ocean of his dark and extravagant fiction.
But, omitting the comparison of individual minds, which can afford no general inference, how superior was the spirit and system of their poetry to that of any other period! So that had any other genius equal in other respects to the greatest that ever enlightened the world, arisen in that age, he would have been superior to all, from this circumstance alone—that had conceptions would have assumed a more harmonious and perfect form. For it is worthy of observation, that whatever the poet of that age produced is as harmonious and perfect as possible. In a drama, for instance, were the composition of a person of inferior talent, it was still homogeneous and free from inequalities it was a whole, consistent with itself. The compositions of great minds bore throughout the sustained stamp of their greatness. In the poetry of succeeding ages the expectations are often exalted on Icarian wings, and fall, too much disappointed to give a memory and a name to the oblivious pool in which they fell.
In physical knowledge Aristotle and Theophrastus had already—no doubt assisted by the labours of those of their predecessor whom they criticize—made advances worthy of the maturity of science. The astonishing invention of geometry, that series of discoveries which have enabled man to command the element and foresee future events, before the subjects of his ignorant wonder, and which have opened as it were the doors of the mysteries of nature, had already been brought to great perfection. Metaphysics, the science of man's intimate nature, and logic, or the grammar and elementary principles of that science received from the latter philosophers of the Periclean age a firm basis. All our more exact philosophy is built upon the labours of these great men, and many of the words which we employ in metaphysical distinctions were invented by them to give accuracy and system to their reasonings. The science of morals, or the voluntary conduct of men in relation to themselves or others, dates from this epoch. How inexpressibly bolder and more pure were the doctrines of those great men, in comparison with the timid maxims which prevail in the writings of the most esteemed modern moralists! They were such as Phocion, and Epaminondas, and Timoleon, who formed themselves on their influence, were to the wretched heroes of our own age.
Their political and religious institutions are more difficult to bring into comparison with those of other times. A summary idea may be formed of the worth of any political and religious system, by observing the comparative degree of happiness and of intellect produced under its influence. And whilst many institution and opinions, which in ancient Greece were obstacles to the improvement of the human race, have been abolished among modern nations, how many pernicious superstitions and new contrivances of misrule, and unheard-of complications of public mischief, have not been invented among them by the ever-watchful spirit of avarice and tyranny!",,,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage highlights the unparalleled cultural, intellectual, and artistic achievements during the period between the birth of Pericles and the death of Aristotle.

It also compares the poetry of ancient Greece with that of later periods, acknowledging Homer’s superiority while recognizing the merits of Shakespeare and Dante.

For all the inventive arts maintain, as it were, a sympathetic connexion between each other, being no more than various expressions of one internal power, modified by different circumstances, either of an individual, or of society; and the paintings of that period would probably bear the same relation as is confessedly borne by the sculptures to all succeeding ones. Of their music we know little; but the effects which it is said to have produced, whether they be attributed to the skill of the composer, or the sensibility of his audience, are far more powerful than any which we experience from the music of our own times; and if, indeed, the melody of their compositions were more tender and delicate, and inspiring, than the melodies of some modern European nations, their superiority in this art must have been something wonderful, and wholly beyond conception.
Their poetry seems to maintain a very high, though not so disproportionate a rank, in the comparison. Perhaps Shakespeare, from the variety and comprehension of his genius, is to be considered, on the whole, as the greatest individual mind, of which we have specimens remaining. Perhaps Dante created imaginations of greater loveliness and energy than any that are to be found in the ancient literature of Greece. Perhaps nothing has been discovered in the fragments of the Greek lyric poets equivalent to the sublime and chivalric sensibility of Petrarch.—But, as a poet. Homer must be acknowledged to excel Shakespeare in the truth, the harmony, the sustained grandeur, the satisfying completeness of his images, their exact fitness to the illustration, and to that to which they belong. Nor could Dante, deficient in conduct, plan, nature, variety, and temperance, have been brought into comparison with these men, but for those fortunate isles laden with golden fruit, which alone could tempt any one to embark in the misty ocean of his dark and extravagant fiction.
But, omitting the comparison of individual minds, which can afford no general inference, how superior was the spirit and system of their poetry to that of any other period! So that had any other genius equal in other respects to the greatest that ever enlightened the world, arisen in that age, he would have been superior to all, from this circumstance alone—that had conceptions would have assumed a more harmonious and perfect form. For it is worthy of observation, that whatever the poet of that age produced is as harmonious and perfect as possible. In a drama, for instance, were the composition of a person of inferior talent, it was still homogeneous and free from inequalities it was a whole, consistent with itself. The compositions of great minds bore throughout the sustained stamp of their greatness. In the poetry of succeeding ages the expectations are often exalted on Icarian wings, and fall, too much disappointed to give a memory and a name to the oblivious pool in which they fell.
In physical knowledge Aristotle and Theophrastus had already—no doubt assisted by the labours of those of their predecessor whom they criticize—made advances worthy of the maturity of science. The astonishing invention of geometry, that series of discoveries which have enabled man to command the element and foresee future events, before the subjects of his ignorant wonder, and which have opened as it were the doors of the mysteries of nature, had already been brought to great perfection. Metaphysics, the science of man's intimate nature, and logic, or the grammar and elementary principles of that science received from the latter philosophers of the Periclean age a firm basis. All our more exact philosophy is built upon the labours of these great men, and many of the words which we employ in metaphysical distinctions were invented by them to give accuracy and system to their reasonings.

"The period which intervened between the birth of Pericles and the death of Aristotle, is undoubtedly, whether considered in itself, or with reference to the effects which it has produced upon the subsequent destinies of civilized man, the most memorable in the history of the world. What was the combination of moral and political circumstances which produced so unparalleled a progress during that period in literature and the arts;—why that progress, so rapid and so sustained, so soon received a check, and became retrograde,—are problems left to the wonder and conjecture of posterity. The wrecks and fragments of those subtle and profound minds, like the ruins of a fine statue, obscurely suggest to us the grandeur and perfection of the whole. Their very language—a type of the understandings of which it was the creation and the image—in variety, in simplicity, in flexibility, and in copiousness, excels every other language of the western world. Their sculptures are such as we, in our presumption, assume to be the models of ideal truth and beauty, and to which no artist of modern times can produce forms in any degree comparable. Their paintings, according to Pliny and Pausanias, were full of delicacy and harmony; and some even were powerfully pathetic, so as to awaken, like tender music or tragic poetry, the most overwhelming emotions.

"Immanuel Kant is generally regarded as the greatest of the modern philosophers. Though he lived through the Seven Years War and the French Revolution, he never interrupted his teaching of philosophy at Königsberg in East Prussia. His most distinctive contribution was the invention of what he called the 'critical' philosophy, which, assuming as a datum that there is knowledge of various kinds, inquired how such knowledge comes to be possible, and deduced, from the answer to this inquiry, many metaphysical results as to the nature of the world. Whether these results were valid may well be doubted. But Kant undoubtedly deserves credit for two things: first, for having perceived that we have a priori knowledge which is not purely 'analytic', i.e. such that the opposite would be self-contradictory, and secondly, for having made evident the philosophical importance of the theory of knowledge.
Before the time of Kant, it was generally held that whatever knowledge was a priori must be 'analytic'. What this word means will be best illustrated by examples. If I say, 'A bald man is a man', 'A plane figure is a figure', 'A bad poet is a poet', I make a purely analytic judgement: the subject spoken about is given as having at least two properties, of which one is singled out to be asserted of it. Such propositions as the above are trivial, and would never be enunciated in real life except by an orator preparing the way for a piece of sophistry. They are called 'analytic' because the predicate is obtained by merely analysing the subject. Before the time of Kant it was thought that all judgements of which we could be certain a priori were of this kind: that in all of them there was a predicate which was only part of the subject of which it was asserted. If this were so, we should be involved in a definite contradiction if we attempted to deny anything that could be known a priori. 'A bald man is not bald' would assert and deny baldness of the same man, and would therefore contradict itself. Thus according to the philosophers before Kant, the law of contradiction, which asserts that nothing can at the same time have and not have a certain property, sufficed to establish the truth of all a priori knowledge.
Hume (1711-76), who preceded Kant, accepting the usual view as to what makes knowledge a priori, discovered that, in many cases which had previously been supposed analytic, and notably in the case of cause and effect, the connexion was really synthetic. Before Hume, rationalists at least had supposed that the effect could be logically deduced from the cause, if only we had sufficient knowledge. Hume argued—correctly, as would now be generally admitted—that this could not be done. Hence he inferred the far more doubtful proposition that nothing could be known a priori about the connexion of cause and effect. Kant, who had been educated in the rationalist tradition, was much perturbed by Hume's scepticism, and endeavoured to find an answer to it. He perceived that not only the connexion of cause and effect, but all the propositions of arithmetic and geometry, are 'synthetic', i.e. not analytic: in all these propositions, no analysis of the subject will reveal the predicate. His stock instance was the proposition 7 + 5 = 12. He pointed out, quite truly, that 7 and 5 have to be put together to give 12: the idea of 12 is not contained in them, nor even in the idea of adding them together. Thus he was led to the conclusion that all pure mathematics, though a priori, is synthetic; and this conclusion raised a new problem of which he endeavoured to find the solution.
The question which Kant put at the beginning of his philosophy, namely 'How is pure mathematics possible?' is an interesting and difficult one, to which every philosophy which is not purely sceptical must find some answer. The answer of the pure empiricists, that our mathematical knowledge is derived by induction from particular instances, we have already seen to be inadequate, for two reasons: first, that the validity of the inductive principle itself cannot be proved by induction; secondly, that the general propositions of mathematics, such as 'two and two always make four', can obviously be known with certainty by consideration of a single instance, and gain nothing by enumeration of other cases in which they have been found to be true. Thus our knowledge of the general propositions of mathematics (and the same applies to logic) must be accounted for otherwise than our (merely probable) knowledge of empirical generalizations such as 'all men are mortal'.",,,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"Immanuel Kant is regarded as a pivotal modern philosopher notable for his 'critical' philosophy, which examines how knowledge is possible, resulting in substantial metaphysical implications.

"What, then, is the rightful limit to the sovereignty of the individual over himself? Where does the authority of society begin? How much of human life should be assigned to individuality, and how much to society?
Each will receive its proper share, if each has that which more particularly concerns it. To individuality should belong the part of life in which it is chiefly the individual that is interested; to society, the part which chiefly interests society.
Though society is not founded on a contract, and though no good purpose is answered by inventing a contract in order to deduce social obligations from it, every one who receives the protection of society owes a return for the benefit, and the fact of living in society renders it indispensable that each should be bound to[Pg 141] observe a certain line of conduct towards the rest. This conduct consists, first, in not injuring the interests of one another; or rather certain interests which, either by express legal provision or by tacit understanding, ought to be considered as rights; and secondly, in each person's bearing his share (to be fixed on some equitable principle) of the labours and sacrifices incurred for defending the society or its members from injury and molestation. These conditions society is justified in enforcing, at all costs to those who endeavour to withhold fulfilment. Nor is this all that society may do. The acts of an individual may be hurtful to others, or wanting in due consideration for their welfare, without going the length of violating any of their constituted rights. The offender may then be justly punished by opinion though not by law. As soon as any part of a person's conduct affects prejudicially the interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it, and the question whether the general welfare will or will not be promoted by interfering with it, becomes open to discussion. But there is no room for entertaining any such question when a person's conduct affects the interests of no persons besides himself, or needs not affect them unless they like (all the persons concerned being of full age, and[Pg 142] the ordinary amount of understanding). In all such cases there should be perfect freedom, legal and social, to do the action and stand the consequences.
It would be a great misunderstanding of this doctrine, to suppose that it is one of selfish indifference, which pretends that human beings have no business with each other's conduct in life, and that they should not concern themselves about the well-doing or well-being of one another, unless their own interest is involved. Instead of any diminution, there is need of a great increase of disinterested exertion to promote the good of others. But disinterested benevolence can find other instruments to persuade people to their good, than whips and scourges, either of the literal or the metaphorical sort. I am the last person to undervalue the self-regarding virtues; they are only second in importance, if even second, to the social. It is equally the business of education to cultivate both. But even education works by conviction and persuasion as well as by compulsion, and it is by the former only that, when the period of education is past, the self-regarding virtues should be inculcated. Human beings owe to each other help to distinguish the better from the worse, and encouragement to choose the[Pg 143] former and avoid the latter. They should be for ever stimulating each other to increased exercise of their higher faculties, and increased direction of their feelings and aims towards wise instead of foolish, elevating instead of degrading, objects and contemplations. But neither one person, nor any number of persons, is warranted in saying to another human creature of ripe years, that he shall not do with his life for his own benefit what he chooses to do with it. He is the person most interested in his own well-being: the interest which any other person, except in cases of strong personal attachment, can have in it, is trifling, compared with that which he himself has; the interest which society has in him individually (except as to his conduct to others) is fractional, and altogether indirect: while, with respect to his own feelings and circumstances, the most ordinary man or woman has means of knowledge immeasurably surpassing those that can be possessed by any one else. The interference of society to overrule his judgment and purposes in what only regards himself, must be grounded on general presumptions; which may be altogether wrong, and even if right, are as likely as not to be misapplied to individual cases, by persons no better acquainted with the circumstances of such[Pg 144] cases than those are who look at them merely from without. In this department, therefore, of human affairs, Individuality has its proper field of action. In the conduct of human beings towards one another, it is necessary that general rules should for the most part be observed, in order that people may know what they have to expect; but in each person's own concerns, his individual spontaneity is entitled to free exercise. Considerations to aid his judgment, exhortations to strengthen his will, may be offered to him, even obtruded on him, by others; but he himself is the final judge. All errors which he is likely to commit against advice and warning, are far outweighed by the evil of allowing others to constrain him to what they deem his good.
I do not mean that the feelings with which a person is regarded by others, ought not to be in any way affected by his self-regarding qualities or deficiencies. This is neither possible nor desirable. If he is eminent in any of the qualities which conduce to his own good, he is, so far, a proper object of admiration. He is so much the nearer to the ideal perfection of human nature. If he is grossly deficient in those qualities, a sentiment the opposite of admiration will follow. There is a degree of folly, and a degree of what may be[Pg 145] called (though the phrase is not unobjectionable) lowness or depravation of taste, which, though it cannot justify doing harm to the person who manifests it, renders him necessarily and properly a subject of distaste, or, in extreme cases, even of contempt: a person could not have the opposite qualities in due strength without entertaining these feelings. Though doing no wrong to any one, a person may so act as to compel us to judge him, and feel to him, as a fool, or as a being of an inferior order: and since this judgment and feeling are a fact which he would prefer to avoid, it is doing him a service to warn him of it beforehand, as of any other disagreeable consequence to which he exposes himself. It would be well, indeed, if this good office were much more freely rendered than the common notions of politeness at present permit, and if one person could honestly point out to another that he thinks him in fault, without being considered unmannerly or presuming. We have a right, also, in various ways, to act upon our unfavourable opinion of any one, not to the oppression of his individuality, but in the exercise of ours. We are not bound, for example, to seek his society; we have a right to avoid it (though not to parade the avoidance), for we have a right to choose the society most acceptable to us. We[Pg 146] have a right, and it may be our duty, to caution others against him, if we think his example or conversation likely to have a pernicious effect on those with whom he associates. We may give others a preference over him in optional good offices, except those which tend to his improvement. In these various modes a person may suffer very severe penalties at the hands of others, for faults which directly concern only himself; but he suffers these penalties only in so far as they are the natural, and, as it were, the spontaneous consequences of the faults themselves, not because they are purposely inflicted on him for the sake of punishment. A person who shows rashness, obstinacy, self-conceit—who cannot live within moderate means—who cannot restrain himself from hurtful indulgences—who pursues animal pleasures at the expense of those of feeling and intellect—must expect to be lowered in the opinion of others, and to have a less share of their favourable sentiments; but of this he has no right to complain, unless he has merited their favour by special excellence in his social relations, and has thus established a title to their good offices, which is not affected by his demerits towards himself.",,,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage discusses the appropriate boundaries between individual sovereignty and societal authority. It posits that individuals should have autonomy over their personal actions unless those actions negatively impact others. Society can enforce rules to ensure individuals do not harm one another and contribute fairly to communal well-being. While society can influence individual behavior through opinion and encouragement, it should not override personal judgment concerning self-regarding actions. Individuals must accept social judgment and suffer natural consequences for personal faults, but coercion should be limited to cases where others are directly affected.

Each will receive its proper share, if each has that which more particularly concerns it. To individuality should belong the part of life in which it is chiefly the individual that is interested; to society, the part which chiefly interests society.
Though society is not founded on a contract, and though no good purpose is answered by inventing a contract in order to deduce social obligations from it, every one who receives the protection of society owes a return for the benefit, and the fact of living in society renders it indispensable that each should be bound to[Pg 141] observe a certain line of conduct towards the rest. This conduct consists, first, in not injuring the interests of one another; or rather certain interests which, either by express legal provision or by tacit understanding, ought to be considered as rights; and secondly, in each person's bearing his share (to be fixed on some equitable principle) of the labours and sacrifices incurred for defending the society or its members from injury and molestation. These conditions society is justified in enforcing, at all costs to those who endeavour to withhold fulfilment. Nor is this all that society may do. The acts of an individual may be hurtful to others, or wanting in due consideration for their welfare, without going the length of violating any of their constituted rights. The offender may then be justly punished by opinion though not by law. As soon as any part of a person's conduct affects prejudicially the interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it, and the question whether the general welfare will or will not be promoted by interfering with it, becomes open to discussion. But there is no room for entertaining any such question when a person's conduct affects the interests of no persons besides himself, or needs not affect them unless they like (all the persons concerned being of full age, and[Pg 142] the ordinary amount of understanding). In all such cases there should be perfect freedom, legal and social, to do the action and stand the consequences.
It would be a great misunderstanding of this doctrine, to suppose that it is one of selfish indifference, which pretends that human beings have no business with each other's conduct in life, and that they should not concern themselves about the well-doing or well-being of one another, unless their own interest is involved. Instead of any diminution, there is need of a great increase of disinterested exertion to promote the good of others. But disinterested benevolence can find other instruments to persuade people to their good, than whips and scourges, either of the literal or the metaphorical sort. I am the last person to undervalue the self-regarding virtues; they are only second in importance, if even second, to the social. It is equally the business of education to cultivate both. But even education works by conviction and persuasion as well as by compulsion, and it is by the former only that, when the period of education is past, the self-regarding virtues should be inculcated. Human beings owe to each other help to distinguish the better from the worse, and encouragement to choose the[Pg 143] former and avoid the latter. They should be for ever stimulating each other to increased exercise of their higher faculties, and increased direction of their feelings and aims towards wise instead of foolish, elevating instead of degrading, objects and contemplations. But neither one person, nor any number of persons, is warranted in saying to another human creature of ripe years, that he shall not do with his life for his own benefit what he chooses to do with it. He is the person most interested in his own well-being: the interest which any other person, except in cases of strong personal attachment, can have in it, is trifling, compared with that which he himself has; the interest which society has in him individually (except as to his conduct to others) is fractional, and altogether indirect: while, with respect to his own feelings and circumstances, the most ordinary man or woman has means of knowledge immeasurably surpassing those that can be possessed by any one else. The interference of society to overrule his judgment and purposes in what only regards himself, must be grounded on general presumptions; which may be altogether wrong, and even if right, are as likely as not to be misapplied to individual cases, by persons no better acquainted with the circumstances of such[Pg 144] cases than those are who look at them merely from without. In this department, therefore, of human affairs, Individuality has its proper field of action. In the conduct of human beings towards one another, it is necessary that general rules should for the most part be observed, in order that people may know what they have to expect; but in each person's own concerns, his individual spontaneity is entitled to free exercise. Considerations to aid his judgment, exhortations to strengthen his will, may be offered to him, even obtruded on him, by others; but he himself is the final judge. All errors which he is likely to commit against advice and warning, are far outweighed by the evil of allowing others to constrain him to what they deem his good.
I do not mean that the feelings with which a person is regarded by others, ought not to be in any way affected by his self-regarding qualities or deficiencies. This is neither possible nor desirable. If he is eminent in any of the qualities which conduce to his own good, he is, so far, a proper object of admiration. He is so much the nearer to the ideal perfection of human nature. If he is grossly deficient in those qualities, a sentiment the opposite of admiration will follow. There is a degree of folly, and a degree of what may be[Pg 145] called (though the phrase is not unobjectionable) lowness or depravation of taste, which, though it cannot justify doing harm to the person who manifests it, renders him necessarily and properly a subject of distaste, or, in extreme cases, even of contempt: a person could not have the opposite qualities in due strength without entertaining these feelings. Though doing no wrong to any one, a person may so act as to compel us to judge him, and feel to him, as a fool, or as a being of an inferior order: and since this judgment and feeling are a fact which he would prefer to avoid, it is doing him a service to warn him of it beforehand, as of any other disagreeable consequence to which he exposes himself. It would be well, indeed, if this good office were much more freely rendered than the common notions of politeness at present permit, and if one person could honestly point out to another that he thinks him in fault, without being considered unmannerly or presuming. We have a right, also, in various ways, to act upon our unfavourable opinion of any one, not to the oppression of his individuality, but in the exercise of ours. We are not bound, for example, to seek his society; we have a right to avoid it (though not to parade the avoidance), for we have a right to choose the society most acceptable to us. We[Pg 147] have a right, and it may be our duty, to caution others against him, if we think his example or conversation likely to have a pernicious effect on those with whom he associates. We may give others a preference over him in optional good offices, except those which tend to his improvement. In these various modes a person may suffer very severe penalties at the hands of others, for faults which directly concern only himself; but he suffers these penalties only in so far as they are the natural, and, as it were, the spontaneous consequences of the faults themselves, not because they are purposely inflicted on him for the sake of punishment. A person who shows rashness, obstinacy, self-conceit—who cannot live within moderate means—who cannot restrain himself from hurtful indulgences—who pursues animal pleasures at the expense of those of feeling and intellect—must expect to be lowered in the opinion of others, and to have a less share of their favourable sentiments; but of this he has no right to complain, unless he has merited their favour by special excellence in his social relations, and has thus established a title to their good offices, which is not affected by his demerits towards himself.",,,GPT-4o,哲学,英文,"The passage discusses the appropriate boundaries between individual sovereignty and societal authority.

"No moral Principles so clear and so generally received as the forementioned speculative Maxims.
If those speculative Maxims, whereof we discoursed in the foregoing chapter, have not an actual universal assent from all mankind, as we there proved, it is much more visible concerning PRACTICAL Principles, that they come short of an universal reception: and I think it will be hard to instance any one moral rule which can pretend to so general and ready an assent as, “What is, is”; or to be so manifest a truth as this, that “It is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be.” Whereby it is evident that they are further removed from a title to be innate; and the doubt of their being native impressions on the mind is stronger against those moral principles than the other. Not that it brings their truth at all in question. They are equally true, though not equally evident. Those speculative maxims carry their own evidence with them: but moral principles require reasoning and discourse, and some exercise of the mind, to discover the certainty of their truth. They lie not open as natural characters engraved on the mind; which, if any such were, they must needs be visible by themselves, and by their own light be certain and known to everybody. But this is no derogation to their truth and certainty; no more than it is to the truth or certainty of the three angles of a triangle being equal to two right ones because it is not so evident as “the whole is bigger than a part,” nor so apt to be assented to at first hearing. It may suffice that these moral rules are capable of demonstration: and therefore it is our own faults if we come not to a certain knowledge of them. But the ignorance wherein many men are of them, and the slowness of assent wherewith others receive them, are manifest proofs that they are not innate, and such as offer themselves to their view without searching.
Faith and Justice not owned as Principles by all Men.
Whether there be any such moral principles, wherein all men do agree, I appeal to any who have been but moderately conversant in the history of mankind, and looked abroad beyond the smoke of their own chimneys. Where is that practical truth that is universally received, without doubt or question, as it must be if innate? JUSTICE, and keeping of contracts, is that which most men seem to agree in. This is a principle which is thought to extend itself to the dens of thieves, and the confederacies of the greatest villains; and they who have gone furthest towards the putting off of humanity itself, keep faith and rules of justice one with another. I grant that outlaws themselves do this one amongst another: but it is without receiving these as the innate laws of nature. They practise them as rules of convenience within their own communities: but it is impossible to conceive that he embraces justice as a practical principle who acts fairly with his fellow-highwayman, and at the same time plunders or kills the next honest man he meets with. Justice and truth are the common ties of society; and therefore even outlaws and robbers, who break with all the world besides, must keep faith and rules of equity amongst themselves; or else they cannot hold together. But will any one say, that those that live by fraud or rapine have innate principles of truth and justice which they allow and assent to?
Objection: though Men deny them in their Practice, yet they admit them in their Thoughts answered.
Perhaps it will be urged, that the tacit assent of their minds agrees to what their practice contradicts. I answer, first, I have always thought the actions of men the best interpreters of their thoughts. But, since it is certain that most men’s practices, and some men’s open professions, have either questioned or denied these principles, it is impossible to establish an universal consent, (though we should look for it only amongst grown men,) without which it is impossible to conclude them innate. Secondly, it is very strange and unreasonable to suppose innate practical principles, that terminate only in contemplation.

"No moral Principles so clear and so generally received as the forementioned speculative Maxims.
If those speculative Maxims, whereof we discoursed in the foregoing chapter, have not an actual universal assent from all mankind, as we there proved, it is much more visible concerning PRACTICAL Principles, that they come short of an universal reception: and I think it will be hard to instance any one moral rule which can pretend to so general and ready an assent as, “What is, is”; or to be so manifest a truth as this, that “It is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be.” Whereby it is evident that they are further removed from a title to be innate; and the doubt of their being native impressions on the mind is stronger against those moral principles than the other. Not that it brings their truth at all in question. They are equally true, though not equally evident. Those speculative maxims carry their own evidence with them: but moral principles require reasoning and discourse, and some exercise of the mind, to discover the certainty of their truth. They lie not open as natural characters engraved on the mind; which, if any such were, they must needs be visible by themselves, and by their own light be certain and known to everybody. But this is no derogation to their truth and certainty; no more than it is to the truth or certainty of the three angles of a triangle being equal to two right ones because it is not so evident as “the whole is bigger than a part,” nor so apt to be assented to at first hearing. It may suffice that these moral rules are capable of demonstration: and therefore it is our own faults if we come not to a certain knowledge of them. But the ignorance wherein many men are of them, and the slowness of assent wherewith others receive them, are manifest proofs that they are not innate, and such as offer themselves to their view without searching.
Faith and Justice not owned as Principles by all Men.
Whether there be any such moral principles, wherein all men do agree, I appeal to any who have been but moderately conversant in the history of mankind, and looked abroad beyond the smoke of their own chimneys. Where is that practical truth that is universally received, without doubt or question, as it must be if innate? JUSTICE, and keeping of contracts, is that which most men seem to agree in. This is a principle which is thought to extend itself to the dens of thieves, and the confederacies of the greatest villains; and they who have gone furthest towards the putting off of humanity itself, keep faith and rules of justice one with another. I grant that outlaws themselves do this one amongst another: but it is without receiving these as the innate laws of nature. They practise them as rules of convenience within their own communities: but it is impossible to conceive that he embraces justice as a practical principle who acts fairly with his fellow-highwayman, and at the same time plunders or kills the next honest man he meets with. Justice and truth are the common ties of society; and therefore even outlaws and robbers, who break with all the world besides, must keep faith and rules of equity amongst themselves; or else they cannot hold together. But will any one say, that those that live by fraud or rapine have innate principles of truth and justice which they allow and assent to?
Objection: though Men deny them in their Practice, yet they admit them in their Thoughts answered.
Perhaps it will be urged, that the tacit assent of their minds agrees to what their practice contradicts. I answer, first, I have always thought the actions of men the best interpreters of their thoughts. But, since it is certain that most men’s practices, and some men’s open professions, have either questioned or denied these principles, it is impossible to establish an universal consent, (though we should look for it only amongst grown men,) without which it is impossible to conclude them innate. Secondly, it is very strange and unreasonable to suppose innate practical principles, that terminate only in contemplation.

As regards materialistic atomism, it is one of the best-refuted theories that have been advanced, and in Europe there is now perhaps no one in the learned world so unscholarly as to attach serious signification to it, except for convenient everyday use (as an abbreviation of the means of expression)—thanks chiefly to the Pole Boscovich: he and the Pole Copernicus have hitherto been the greatest and most successful opponents of ocular evidence. For while Copernicus has persuaded us to believe, contrary to all the senses, that the earth does NOT stand fast, Boscovich has taught us to abjure the belief in the last thing that ""stood fast"" of the earth—the belief in ""substance,"" in ""matter,"" in the earth-residuum, and particle-atom: it is the greatest triumph over the senses that has hitherto been gained on earth. One must, however, go still further, and also declare war, relentless war to the knife, against the ""atomistic requirements"" which still lead a dangerous after-life in places where no one suspects them, like the more celebrated ""metaphysical requirements"": one must also above all give the finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism which Christianity has taught best and longest, the SOUL-ATOMISM.

Psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down the instinct of self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic being.
